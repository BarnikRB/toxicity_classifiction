eng_dev_1	It wasn't Giuliani's doing, it was a combination of many things, but least of all anything Giuliani did. It was the economic boom of the 90s; it was the ultimate effect of Roe v. Wade in lowering the number of unwanted births and thus children who grow up in a bad environment; and it was the general lowering of the crime rate across the US. I'm sure you wouldn't give Bill Clinton credit for that. Giuliani just took credit.	0	0

eng_dev_5	Don't you know corporations doing really pay corporate taxes, they collect it from their consumers with higher prices. Cooperate taxes are a simply pass through tax. By doing away with many of the loopholes and lowering the rate will amount to collecting a smaller percentage on a larger total of taxable income. If you only look at the difference is the percentages without factoring in the increase in total taxable dollars due to removing the loopholes, then your conclusions and accusations are just wrong.	0	0

eng_dev_7	Wow - this writer clearly hates Republicans. Right off the bat, she misles the readers by comparing the results to Tom Price's victories - instead of comparing them to the Presidential election. Republicans increased their margin of victory from 1.5% to 3.8%. Price's previous large margins were simply a testament to how much the voters disliked the Obama administration.	0	0

eng_dev_25	So many of the poster solutions rely on: tax the other guy, cut the program I never use, everyone is overpaid but me.  Those who are so positive they can live without so many State services need to simply live for the next year without relying on anything provided by the State.  Don't drive on state roads, drive your kids to school (no school buses,)  do not use anything that receives state funding.  When you get your property tax bill look at the amount that shown as state revenues you are receiving towards the municipality operation as  that local funding is also part of the budget problem.	0	0

eng_dev_33	"""The theory that Colorado drivers are some of the worst in the nation now has data to back it up.""  I disagree.  In my experience, New York, Massachusetts, and Quebec drivers are among the very worst.  Colorado drivers are more polite than those on the coasts — more likely to yield and let you into their lane, for example.  But no more polite than those in the Midwest or South.  The greatest sin of Colorado drivers is the sin of pride.  The think they are better on the snow or ice than newcomers but, thanks to that familiarity, they actually are merely pushing the envelope and inviting an accident.  I'm sure the State Patrol would agree that Colorado drivers don't modify their behavior to match deteriorated conditions nearly enough.  That are NOT bulletproof."	0	0

eng_dev_35	"The problem with so much of the outcries is that they attack the person rather than addressing the content. It is a resurgence of the ""Love it or leave it!"" cries of the '60's & '70's. If the actor or speaker's premise is wrong, then point it out and support your position. These comment threads often suffer from the same dynamic, becoming a series of personal attacks rather than a discussion of the point(s) originally raised. Throwing verbal attacks may be satisfying, but it neither convinces anyone nor advances the discussion towards a resolution or understanding."	0	0

""He is arrogant but he might use that arrogance in my behalf instead of using it to hide his real beliefs  on a private server or behind closed doors while collecting millions from the fat cats in Wall Street.""  I think the Podesta e-mails revealed the true character of Hillary and her party elite handlers and it wasn't  ""stupidity"" to react negatively to what was revealed."	1	1

eng_dev_43	Ah, Mark Begich.  I wrote a letter to the editor to the ADN, way back when it was the Anchorage Daily News, rather than within the current form, and it was actually published.  Look it up if you like, but what I said then still stands now.  Mark Begich, at one point, early within his career, was an Alaskan Democrat, supportive of issues that would make Alaska a better place for all citizens.  Then he was elected as a United States Senator, and suddenly, ALL bets, regarding Alaska, were off the table.  He was no longer an Alaskan Democrat.  He had become, and is still now, a Washington Liberal, supporting the Washington Liberal stances rather than the Alaskan stances that he used to.  Within other words, Mark Begich has sold out unto the Washington Liberal ideology whilst abandoning the citizens of Alaska, and because of said betrayal, deserves no consideration, no respect, and certainly no forgiveness of said betrayal.  His name should be forgotten, and never mentioned again.  Period.	0	0

The people stealing & shooting are accountable The folks who don't secure their weapons properly are accountable  The failed system that leaves them in the stret even after being caught is accountable  No one wants to shoulder the blame because everyone wants to say ""I'm Right and you're wrong""   Though realistically I'd be interested to know the number of guns that have been used in shootings this year alone that were originally the property of a registered owner.  There is no guaranteed solution but a conversation about the subject that does more than point fingers would be a step in the right direction."	0	0

eng_dev_61	"Randy brings up tweets about Leslie Jones and how people ""tweet negatively"" as if they are panning the movie, and expresses bewilderment why people would be labeled racist. But why be vague? Let everyone decide? How about: ""Your Ghostbusters isn't the first to have an ape in it"" ""Big lipped c--n, big lipped c--n, big lipped c--n"" ""This Leslie (Kong) has a funny face"" and many more tweets of apes.   So, yes, people are racist and it shouldn't be hard to say that and not just refer to to as ""negative"".   When people tweet and it ends their career, the people doing the firing are corporations, not usually portrayed as the most liberal. Isn't this a perfectly fine outcome of free speech? Someone says something stupid, many people say, ""I'm offended"" (as is their right), and corporations cover their rear end. That person can still tweet dumb things, but just not while costing a company sales."	1	1

eng_dev_68	That's a lot of quibbling. The fact remains, the Clinton administration had the last vibrant economy with high growth and revenues exceeding expenses that the US has seen since. That's a fact, Jack, no matter how you spin it. Clinton had the dot.com bubble, Bush II had the housing bubble; but cutting taxes while fighting two mostly unnecessary wars (many say completely unnecessary) took us back into deficit spending big time, and Bush II didn't bother to take a good look at how highly leveraged all that property wealth was. So that money went up in smoke. I give Bush II credit for TARP, without which our economy would have ground to a complete halt.  Obama managed to get unemployment from 10% at the bottom of his inherited recession, to 4.7% when he left office. Hiis policies would have worked quicker if Republicans in Congress hadn't refused Obama even the slightest direct jobs stimulus.	0	0

eng_dev_73	What the Colorado tourism people promote is our wilderness, not the rural areas.  When the word rural is mentioned it brings to mind Eastern Colorado and not the Western Slope or the Rocky Mountains.  That is most of what the article is based on as well.  Nothing that the rest of us can be reasonably expected to do for them will bring any of the small towns of Eastern Colorado back to economic vibrancy. The pressure of the free market and technology will if anything diminish these areas by decreasing the labor needed for agriculture further still in the coming decade.  I'm sorry if the land that their great grandparents homesteaded can no longer provide a living or a tax base, but I would no more offer them a subsidy for their lifestyle than I would expect them to provide one to me in the suburbs.	0	0

eng_dev_77	The estimated time from Hoopili to Ala Moana is 36 minutes.  As for long queues and inconvenience of getting to and from the rail station...  With the rail you can reduce frequency of some country-to-town buses and use those buses as shuttles to and from the rail stations instead.  Rail cars come, I think, every 7 minutes, so if you run shuttles every 5-10 minutes during peak times the queue won't be long because everyone won't be arriving on the same shuttle.  You get from west Oahu to town in a consistent amount of time, regardless of freeway traffic.  The solutions are there if people actually want to find them.  Most people on here rather come up with some contrived scenario designed to make the project look as valueless as possible.	0	0

eng_dev_98	"—con'td]  Following commands—even giving ear to them—without judgment and self-awareness does not make us better people.  ""The Eichmann Defense"" comes to mind, here.  Sometimes, ""obedience"" is necessary for life, such as a person's simply doing what the police say.  On the other hand, America is founded on a long history of ""Civil Disobedience,"" which was a necessary preamble to the American Revolution, and which informed Thoreau, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King the writings of Howard Zinn, and the ""Occupy Wall Street"" movement.  And then, of course, we have Jan Hus, Martin Luther, and Gandhi.  You may not agree with how or why they disobeyed, but disobey, they did.

The key lesson learned, only accepted by major players like CalTrans over the past few years, is that of induced demand. In short, not all car trips are necessary. If we build more travel lanes, we will induce even more unnecessary trips and fill those lanes in less than seven years, with increases in congestion resulting because we won't increase the lanes everywhere at once. It's also been shown that reducing lanes can reduce congestion, albeit not everywhere.  I'm betting we will try to pave our way out of the problems caused by our driving addiction, which is a bit like drinking one's way out of alcoholism.	0	0

Going forward, I really want him to gear up for a battle to fight against our next foreign war, especially if it is in the Middle East. We need to leave that tragic area, just as we left Southeast Asia in the 1970's. We did little good there, and goodness knows we have done little but leave a trail of destabilized nations in our wake since Shock and Awe. To oppose your President, assuming Hillary Clinton is the President, will be difficult, but Peter has done it many times, and I hope he is willing to do it again to bring our troops home and to spend money at home.

The Powers That Be learned their lesson then, and an increasingly consolidated media has been putting those lessons into effect with establishment-oriented messages and astro-turf movements ever since.

Your proposal is stupidly punitive, singling out a group whose actions benefit our society and automobile drivers.  3) Colorado's image as an outdoor recreation Mecca, which includes being a cycling friendly state, is a huge economic draw. It's one of the reasons we won the outdoor retailer show away from Utah. Your idiotic proposal is counter-productive to the development of Colorado's outdoor-based economy.

Frankly, the Tories are a set of fascist fools who just want to get out of the EU so they can roll back all of the social gains of the last 70 years since the end of the Second World War, when the welfare state was started and benefited many people, myself included. I'd never have been able to go to university if the Tories had remained in power. And for those of you that don't believe me, I'd suggest you watch the 'Call the Midwife' series on DSTV, which is set around the late 50s and early 60s.

There was a decided lack of good faith on the Republican side as they set out to wreck the effort. They did nothing put pushed red buttons, worked up their base and played games with Americans' health.  And where are we today? Well, the House has wasted large portions of their sessions on repeal of the ACA. 57 repeal votes so far, I believe. It sure plays well to Palin-America!

It required both parties back when there was more cooperation.  It is better to discuss policy proposals before congress and those that should be.  Clean air?  Repubs want clean air as best I can tell.  It was a perversion of the EPA legislation to say that CO2 related to clean air.  If CO2 is to be regulated, pros and cons should be discussed, and honest legislation related thereto proposed and passed.  The EPA was never meant to regulate non-toxic materials like CO2.  To have done so outside founding EPA legislation was outside the realm of a democratic government where laws and actions have been approved by the representatives of the people.	0	0
eng_dev_331	We have a VA healthcare system and IHS. Why aren't they touted as models of the benefit of a single payer model? They must provide services less expensively than private hospitals and be more efficient. They aren't. They are less efficient. Wait times are disgustingly in humane. But the Canadian system? Two words. Wait times. Especially for non emergent surgery. Why? Not enough providers or rationing.   Insurance companies make profit and have higher reimbursement to hospitals & doctors than Medicare largely.. This incentives the best physicians to accept that plan. It also brings physicians from all over the world, Canada too, to practice in the US. We have the two best cancer centers in the world. People from all over the globe come to visit our specialists. Why? Our system is broken right? It doesn't insure everyone? It's called universal insurance. NOT universal care delivery when needed. Ask the VA.	0	0

Any plans for the oilfields were probably included in those war plans. I would be extremely surprised if they weren't. I agree that it was a mistake to disband the Iraqi Army and the turned out Baathists but The backbone of ISIS did not become even remotely viable until after the withdrawal of all troops from Iraq by Obama and the events in Syria proceeding as they have, under Obama.

To say you empathize implies that you get where the other person is coming from, you 'feel their pain'.  Come now, do you really?  It is far more accurate to say that you are sympathetic to the other, that you have compassion for their plight.  Maybe you'll even stir yourself to help out.

The latest standard, which almost no one has yet, has a maximum speed (which is further attenuated by distance and internal structures) at less than half of gigabit speed.  Comcast tries hard to upsell to faster speeds.  ""How many devices do you have? You need XYZ at least.""  I bought the minimum speed, which Comcast silently doubled a few months later.  No problems.  Do not rent a cable modem from Comcast.  If you pay for at least 25Mbs, their modem is also an open WiFi hotspot for anyone with mischief in mind.  Buying one pays for itself in a few months.

The overuse of opiate pain medications must be stopped.

It is the responsibility of doctors to limit the prescription of narcotics only to responsible persons with the type of pain indicating that form of treatment.  It is no less important for such patients to use them responsibility.  It is the combination over prescribing and irresponsible use that creates the problem.	0	0

Yes you cannot sell secondhand firearms people if you get caught you can get a friendly knock on your door from law enforcement.

Take away his astounding improvisational skills and he was merely good even at the college level. He would have to develop much more discipline and decision making ability to flourish in the NFL, and the league doesn't usually have much patience.

Yes, there are many conditions which must be met. But the sheer fact that it is within the habitable zone makes it more than likely that the three planets may harbor life.	0	0

eng_dev_593	During Coghill's tenure as a Senator and previously as a House Rep, North Pole has achieved the worst water and air in the State.  North Pole has a Koch-owned oil refinery sitting idle - one that will not be sold until the State caves into the Koch demands.    Coghill was part of the SB 21 crowd that brought us to this fiscal crisis.  During the era of the Corrupt Bastards Club about a decade ago,  Coghill had publicly accepted Veco monies although he was never among those that the FBI videotaped in Bill Allen's hotel room with their hands literally in Allen's money jar.    http://www.newsminer.com/news/local_news/air-pollution-at-record-levels-in-north-pole-on-monday/article_072c971c-9606-11e4-81cd-271bf89f6e65.html  http://www.adn.com/politics/article/coghill-tries-undo-position-taken-his-dad-constitution/2014/02/12/  http://www.adn.com/politics/article/ua-faculty-take-aim-coghills-bill-guns-campus/2014/03/08/	0	0

eng_dev_609	McConnell and company care nothing about who this legislation helps or hurts, nor to what degree. All they are doing now is throwing the minimal bits and pieces at specific Republican senators that they need to secure the 51 votes. McConnell has always been about the partisan (Republican) politics regarding health care verses what will actually help the American people the most. Murkowski has taken a stand on certain issues and this latest legislation doesn't address the bulk of those issues, rather it throws a very small band aid at a very small portion of her alleged concerns, in an attempt to get her 'yes' vote. Anything short of securing adequate health care coverage in all facets for Alaskans deserves a 'no' vote. Senator Koch is a lost cause when it comes to Alaskans. His is an automatic 'yes' vote for his puppet masters.	0	0

eng_dev_734	You are lucky to come from a family with the tremendous resources required to send their child to school in England. My children have exceptional teachers who work extremely hard. We've stacked the deck against their success with our children. Our school has a 46% poverty rate. Children come to school at all levels of ability. Some know how to read, some cannot identify one letter of the alphabet. Some have meth-addicted parents who are in jail, some are the children of university professors.  Our school accepts children with behavioral issues (private schools don't have to!), and they are mainstreamed with the rest of the children. The teacher has to reach every one of these students. 33 seven-year-olds, currently,  in a room that was designed for 20.  I invite you to observe a real classroom before you decide that you have all the answers.  Or - why don't you become a teacher and handle a 40-student first grade classroom?

McConnell paid nothing.  Back in 1928, Congress passed a resolution creating the Office of the Attending Physician (OAP) at the Capitol to minister to the medical needs of its members.  Among the services offered by the OAP are regular check-ups, such as many people without health insurance forego.

I assumed everyone knew this. Trains cannot slip through towns on tippy-toes while wearing slippers on their wheels to protect the delicate ears of some city dwellers. Doesn't a lot of RTD light-rail track parallel the tracks of railroad companies? Companies that still drive big diesel-electric locomotives on those tracks? With rumbling and train horns? Or are government trains automatically noisier -- and easier to complain about? I used to live in a high-rise apartment building just a few blocks from the railroad tracks along Santa Fe Drive.

Don't take my word for it, look for yourself.  Real sustainability is not politically correct (birth control in Africa and the middle east), it involves policies that restrict individual freedoms and conflict with strongly held religious and cultural beliefs.

The website to pick the sites was largely advertised on bike blogs, and the neighbors never knew a vote was taking place.  The neighborhood associations were not involved as PBOT claimed.  Adding insult to injury, PBOT refuses to log any complaints.  Just for fun, call 866-512-BIKE, the customer service number Dylan Rivera says logs Biketown complaints, and ask about a random bike station.

A foreign buyer can look at his or her passport and see that it says C-h-i-n-a. Their passport does NOT say C-a-n-a-d-a.  In contrast, the much l-a-r-g-e-r group consists of BUYERS of Canadian passports who have bought over the years, through investor immigrant programs, Canadian passports. They do not show up in the CBC's reporting even though they are a much L-A-R-G-E-R source of the money from China flooding into Vancouver house buys.	0	0

The larger the number and the wider the definition, the more money that can come from the government to be spent.    And, for some advocacy organizations, the broader definition also helps drive their charitable 501c(3) income stream...some for good organizations, and some for  'expenses and salaries' for the fat cats at the top of questionable organizations.    The 'school' definition is written as broadly as it is in part to get more free or reduced lunches (and breakfasts) for kids in the local schools.	0	0

And now we've arrived at a time when that's possible but instead we're all working the same forty hours and afraid of robots taking our jobs. This is because the fruits of the increased productivity aren't going to the workers, they're going to the ownership class. The rich continue to enrich themselves and let the poor, and increasingly the middle class, starve. We can't continue along this path much longer without a fundamental change to our economy. I, for one, still believe in that fifties vision, even if the millionaires who can afford to buy the robots prefer to keep the resulting windfall and not share the results of the increase in productivity with the rest of us.	0	0

So what could possibly happen? Now the vacancy rate for rentals in Victoria is .3%, and prices are escalating in the double digits. Where will the seniors retire to?

Before that it was the Iditarod not having enough money to pay all the prize money .  There was the issue of more dead dogs during the race.  Instead of thanking and saying good bye a long time sponsor for all their support over the years , they attack the sponsor--- and one person in an effort to punish the bank tried to get their town to change banks.  The Iditarod brand is sinking like the NFL . What's really sad is many Iditarod supporters---as we see here---think there is nothing wrong at all in one musher stealing another mushers gear.

It's borderline treasonous, especially given the fact that were BC to have a huge earthquake, along with a huge hit to its economy, I doubt that the rest of Canada would ever be quite so isolationist, unsupportive and uncooperative in terms of helping fellow British Columbians to rebuild and get their economy back on track.

I've had some close calls on bikes on busy traffic days, so I stay off the main roads, using the Interurban and side streets and sidewalks where it's more safe.  At intersections, I always try to make eye contact with drivers and if I don't, I give drivers the right away.

Therefore, the likely impact of the order on the coal industry will be fairly weak in the near term and, at best, mediocre in the long term.

And there is no way to get my hockey equipment to the trunk after backing in without scratching the guy beside me. . Back out slowly.  Just a bit so no one is hurt.  Stop, look, back out some more and repeat until you can see.  It takes longer and the guy waiting thinks you're a doofus until he (or she) has to back out themselves.  The other problem is the person backing out 3 stalls away at the same time.  You have to do a second check for them because they likely can't see you. . Get a camera.

eng_dev_1129	I disagree.  Tax departments of large corporations are staffed with professional accountants who have relatively good prospects for employment elsewhere and are less likely to endanger their livelihood and professional designation for the sake of enriching a corporation (plus, usually amounts being assessed on audit, even though possibly in the tens of millions, are still small compared to a large corporation's other cost centres).  While large corporations and their tax advisors often disagree, in their own favour, with the CRA on the interpretation of a certain section of the Income Tax Act, the biggest actual cheats who knowingly advise their clients to commit tax fraud are small firms, who are willing to roll the dice that their client is never audited and even if he is, the penalties are relatively small.

The hearing went well, up to a point. Then acting chairman Keller  asked the 21 year old UAF student speaking in support of the joint resolution the following non-question: “I’m sure you are aware of the information that’s floating around the Internet, and I’d like to give you the opportunity to respond to your connection, the Girl Scout connection, with Planned Parenthood and the activist role in that — is there a connection?

An open, accountable and transparent licensing process should not be operated in such fashion. The current Canadian regulatory model appears to be one of the most stringent, if not the most stringent, in the world and the pass rate for the current Canadian examination is by far the lowest amongst comparable jurisdictions. What justifies this level of Canadian exceptionalism? The onus lies on those who regulate, and those who propose to self-regulate, to respond to this question.	0	0

If Oregon has 4 million folks today,  and probably 5 million in nine years,  all that increase in population certainly should produce a mass of self sufficient,  hard working,  contributing people to our population.

About 25 years ago my husband started his business. For several years, he and the kids had no medical insurance because the company I worked for didn't provide family medical insurance. We bought a catastrophic policy ""just in case"" and paid cash for ordinary medical care. The point is that we didn't expect other people to provide for us. We provided for ourselves. Now, providing for you is driving my premiums through the roof.

That's the basic reason for not accepting SB 26.  Additionally, an Income, Motor Fuel, Studded Tire, increased fees, fines, etc., are not needed because the government is already over-bloated.

The Reserves were planned to have $9.3 billion coming in, $2.9 billion from October's distribution and $3.1 billion taken from the Reserves, leaving us with $9 billion going into FY 18.  FY 18 would have that $9 billion going in, an additional $3.4 billion in October, and $2.5 billion taken out, with $9.9 billion left in reserves.

eng_dev_1352	Certainly, your take on the course of events here is entirely yours.   However, there's a backstory. During the campaign and going back to the initial announcement of his candidacy, Mr. Trump made a point of singling out immigrants and immigration as a principle focus of his campaign and his statements expressed that he'd pursue deportation as a remedy. While vague on specifics on how that would be accomplished, Mr. Ramos sought to press him for further explanation and clarity in a manner that I would term aggressive, get-out-the-story reporting but you see as heckling.  Being a private citizen in the public eye, Mr. Trump has basked in positive media attention [some of his own creation, such as the mock-up Time Magazine covers]  but recoils when that attention becomes probing or critical. As POTUS, he's got to accept that level of scrutiny and  demonstrate leadership  instead of participating in a tit-for-tat social media distraction.	0	0

Whether their beliefs are based in religion, politics or any other concept, people may collectively associate in groups that share those ideas while lawfully seeking to advance them. At the same time an individual can never, against his will, be forced to accept those ideas.  TWU doesn't force anyone to accept their beliefs of what's right and wrong. Prospective students have four options. 1) To agree with and abide by TWU's rules. 2) To disagree with TWU's rules, but to follow them anyway. 3) To disagree with TWU's rules and secretly (and lawfully) behave against them, or 4) to seek an education elsewhere.  As you can see, TWU's rules are heavily weighted in favour of those who don't agree with them. Those who disagree have multiple alternatives. Those who agree with the rules have but one choice. Please explain whose fundamental rights are being violated.	0	0

In the Canadian context, the 1st step would be changing the electoral system to ensure one party (Liberal) rule as in a preferential ballot system or creating a one party media.  It seems the one party media may be the easier hill to climb.  You do this by continuing to build up funding and staff for the government media (CBC, PMO, departmental information units, etc.) while the market sector media continues to bleed money and staff.  Eventually, you have a one party media as in Cuba, China, North Korea, etc.  And if the communist government of China continues to buy up the property, mountains, retirement communities, high tech companies with military contracts, etc. in BC and then in the GTA and manages to buy off many politicians as in Australia, this will speed up the process."	0	0

It is sad when the so called conservative party hasn't submitted a balanced budget for over 50 years.    As for the ACA, just remember that this was a republican invention when republicans still tried to do some good for the country as a whole.  Sadly today, they are only for welfare for the rich, the active transfer of wealth from the middle class to the very rich.  A pity.  Who would have thought that Nixon would have been the last republican president who actually cared about improving the country.	0	0
eng_dev_1548	Universities should start putting plans in place to move to a permanent online environment.We do not have the facilities or money available to provide quality education to all deserving SA students. Pair down university attendance to where physical attendance is necessary. Find country wide venues to accommodate students who do not have internet at home. Roll out internet and fiber as wide, as soon and as well as possible. Have lecturers available to  answer questions online. Break courses up into shorter stints. Look at examples like udemy and udacity. Universities as it currently exists was designed for a bygone era when all knowledge was centralized and available in limited spaces. A redesign of the tertiary education space is needed. We need only make sure that the highest standards are kept and design courses for the students with the education they had and not that which  we wished they had. Universities, as supposed leaders in innovation, should lead this charge.	0	0

An individual has almost zero chance of reforming the practices of a major corporation, especially if that corporation is part of an essential service/product that sustains our family.   Health care is a great example.     Collective bargaining is the only serious chance an individual has for balancing the power in negotiation.

eng_dev_1563	Coming from someone who worked at Mt. I as a teacher assistant and then went on to work as a teacher assistant in the SBBS program (School Based Behavior Support), first at North Star Elementary and then moved to Susitna, I am on the fence with this. I worked with the teacher that piloted the SBBS program (I am assuming this is the program that the kiddos are going to). I was two years at North Star and two years at Susitna before moving out of state. I believed who heartedly that we need an in-between place. When we first started, only children who had been at Mt. I came to use to try out the neighborhood school setting. Then later the door swung both ways (accepting kiddos that needed extra support and needed to try our program before making the decision to send them to Mt. I) or as I said they came to us from Mt. I but still need small classroom sizes and only to be integrated when able. I can say first hand, that this program is essential. See Part 2	0	0

Carrying around an extra gas can is pretty easy, I'm not sure carrying around 300lbs of extra batteries would be as economical.

And definitely juries should carefully weigh all the evidence. But that's not the same as an eyewitness pointing to an innocent man and saying, ""I saw the murderer, and he is that person."" This means that if the defendant is innocent, there's a 75% chance that the eyewitness will wrongfully identify him as the killer. No matter how you look at it, these are extremely bad odds -- so bad that eyewitness identification should have no place in the courtroom. But if we decide to retain it, then there should be a penalty for falsely identifying an innocent party. This would drive home the point that identifying a suspect is a serious matter with consequences."	0	0

Not once have I seen measured or balanced reactions from those who personally benefit from these tax shelters. Truth is, these tax changes WILL hurt incorporated families and individuals who have planned on this gravy train continuing in perpetuity.  Your suggestions amount to an ""easing in"" period which I generally support -- it's a compromise. But it still does not justify keeping them, nor does it mean Canada, as you suggest, becomes a substantively less business-friendly country.  If you have travelled and examined other tax schemes in the OECD, Canada still compares very well -- in the big picture. And that is the nub of the problem: most people impacted by these changes are unable to step back and see the big picture and the ethical issue of extending tax shelters to one group of better off people and not another."	0	0

The insane federal dam-building frenzy to grow communities and economies on the east side of Washington was a purposeful and monstrous crime against nature,  sovereign native tribes and recreational anglers.  All manner of laws and policies were circumvented to create dam building jobs and produce relatively cheap power by in effect burning billions of pacific salmon.  Puget Sound efforts over the last decade now sadly report improvements in only 10 of 50 parameters to measure success.  Canada is working overtime to increase fossil fuel shipping in these already busy and polluted waters.

In the House, things are controlled by the extensive gerrymandering, that is managed, favoring republicans House candidates by the majority of republican-controlled state governments.

That was the first ""final warning"" but there were other times when CC didn't agree with me.   I rated one comment ""uncivil"" three times before they finally gave up and I even wrote to them and told them why it was uncivil - and when a human saw it they agreed.  Since yesterday I'm much more harsh about rating comments and I feel a little bad for rating some uncivil but CC seems to like my recent decisions.   Should I really rate someone ""uncivil"" just because their opinion is completely opposite of mine?

Why should we ONLY learn from their failures ?  In the same vein - if one is proposing a better system than capitalism - it would be disingenuous to pretend nothing good came out of it, even if (like me) you feel the amount of terrible outcomes are not at all worth the cost.

This is how we choose to run our business.  When the 2008 recession hit we weathered it no problem, unlike GM Canada that required a massive government bailout.

The fundamental flaw with socialism is nothing in life is ever free. It becomes subsidized meaning we all either pay for it or the government takes control of a profitable company so they can prop up their feel good campaign.

eng_dev_1891	Renters think sort tem, but you need to think long term, like 20 years.  My house went up an average of $40,000 per year over 20 years, and that makes maintenance look like a drop in the bucket.  So why talk about it?	0	0

eng_dev_1899	"There are many good and bad arguments about moral and civil rights to this issue. However, the game is about a singular notion: winning points to qualify for the playoffs and to seek the ultimate price of claiming its championship.  Every owners and manager's objective is clearly that, even if perhaps every player is not working to that interest. While Kapies position is sound and clearly nobel with  exceptional merit, one must ask what is the real point of the distraction or exhibition, other than a counter push,in that sense what is the real cost here? Neither the world nor the USA is a perfect place, the NFL has greater probelms than an aging quarterback that may or may not have the ""stuff"" to compete any longer. Players, come and go, but the institution of the game still remains, even if it is flawed.  What is the real obligation of management on any given Sunday?"	0	0

eng_dev_1911	Well here is some truth for you. The Human Development Index rates countries based on income, health, and life expectancy to form a quality of life index. The US comes in 8th behind 7 Socialist countries. Interesting to note that we are swiftly becoming one of the countries with the highest disparity in pay. The middle class in America is dying with a small percentage at the top making more money than the majority at the bottom. Opportunities to be successful are dwindling while prices for basics like housing, transportation, and food are dwindling. If you want to better yourself by going to college, you also have to endure a huge debt, taking years to pay off, unlike other countries which promote taxpayer education at the highest levels.	0	0

eng_dev_1923	The present system of compensation is inherently susceptible to exploitation. This includes the exploitation  of workers and shareholders by company executives. No system of compensation should include variable earnings (stock options and cash bonuses) and the executives of large corporations should not be earning more than ten times that of the annual remuneration of their companies' lowest paid employees.   As public companies exist to provide earnings to both shareholders and the public company's executives (and other company employees) shareholders should have a clear expectation that whenever their dividend is cut that executive remuneration should be cut by an equivalent percentage.   The debate shouldn't be focused on the taxation of stock options but rather whether systems of variable compensation should exist at all.	0	0

eng_dev_1974	Obamacare has been a total disaster. It is NOT medical care. It's expensive medical insurance that actually restricts access to care. Premiums in all sectors of the market have gone up by an unsustainable amount. Increased deductibles mean that most healthy people never actually use the insurance they're paying for. Meanwhile, the high price of premiums means that you have less money for your copays, so many people who now have insurance cannot afford actual medical care.  Worse, access to doctors has become impossible. My husband made an appointment the other day for MAY. When he objected, they told him that if his condition gets worse in the interim, to go to the ER - at $1500 a pop. The ER can then give him a referral so he can see a doctor immediately.  All of this was predicted during the debate over the ACA and we were told we were fear-mongering. Turns out we were right.  The ACA was a mistake. Admit it. Get rid of it.

Most of those rust belt states had gone democrat in previous elections.  If Clinton had only won one of them,  she would have won the election.  Unfortunately,  since  Trump has taken the reins, creating jobs hasn't been on the radar.   He's too busy fulfilling the GOP wishlist.

He was described on the programme by people who knew him - devoid of human empathy, utterly ruthless. One person said they certainly experienced evil when in his presence. Decent business people (and some not so decent) wouldn't touch him with a barge-pole.  What they found most disturbing was that Trump met him then told his people, ""I want that guy working for me.""  They also showed Trump in an interview stating that 'Its all about genes."" It was like interviewing someone from the Third Reich.

As far as Kap, I think teams are questioning his commitment to the game and if he will be an effective starter who will consistently win games in the NFL.  That is why he is unsigned.  His political stance is unnecessary baggage.  But if he had the talent and commitment, teams will line up to sign him (no matter his political stance).  Let us say Rodgers, Stafford, Luck or Matt Ryan had the same stance as Kap.  Do you think any of those players will get cut or not signed?  Even teammates will accept a controversial player if he helps them win games on the field on Sundays.  I think with Kap his talent level and production on the field is not enough to supplant the negative publicity he generates.	0	0

If I bought a windows ultrabook with the same build quality at best buy, i'd be looking at starting price of 1000 C$ and up.  What's not to like? Well, the 2nd tier chinese pc makers like Jumper (Lenovo being top tier) are pumping out revisions every month. So this model has had 4 major changes in as many months. Luckily, I was on backorder when V3 came out and cancelled V2 at no additional cost.

Okay, it's good for the company owners and CEOs, but not for anyone else.  And why we do we have to ""protect"" Canadian tech producers?  It's called market competition. Competition is good thing, because it forces companies to become better.  Sadly, that's something the Canadian tech industry does not want.

Giggles of glee from my kids running with sparklers is a wonderful memory.  Best solution I've seen are friends that had rural farms and invited guest to come out to enjoy fireworks away from those who found them irritating, and in some cases emotionally or physically painful.

The very best we've been able to see is a year or two were transparency and accountability where actually improved before the government reverses course.  In that regard Harper deserves a very small amount of credit (with the understanding that the bar is set very low) for creating the PBO and implementing a few of the recommendations from the Gomery Commission.

eng_dev_2116	"There seems to be a good case for 'leveling the playing field' among taxpayers so that wage earners and corporate shareholders are treated reasonably equally. The recent rush to incorporate indicates that organizing one's affairs corporately is significantly better than not doing so, and this deserves attention.   However,  (1) Many of the complaints likely arise (reasonably so) because changes in the tax rules upset tax planning predicated on existing rules. How can one plan if the goal posts keep changing? Proposed changes should try to avoid penalizing those who took the care and trouble to organize their affairs according to existing rules.  (2) It will not be helpful if Libs characterize existing tax rules as ""loopholes"". They are the rules and people have a right, and are expected, to plan according to those rules. That is what tax planning is. People who do so are acting rationally, not immorally."	0	0

eng_dev_2151	Your making my point. Out of those 80 at the time only 6 supported keeping the sports programs .   That shows there isn't a huge amount of support . The attendance numbers , where people put their money where their mouths are , tells it all.    The greater Anchorage area has around 300 thousand people . UAA has what--over 10,ooo students ?  Given those numbers , only around 17oo attend UAA hockey games , counting ushers , players , refs , zam drivers , beer and food vendors and Doyle Woody .  They used to enjoy 6400 fans and sell outs .  People flat out don't care anymore.  If so many cared about the U of A sports they would speak out against cutting them.  Instead , they are speaking out against them.  On top of that the UAA athletic director must want hockey cut----why else would he show home games on TV allowing cheap skates and the lazy to not attend hurting the bottom line ? Again I ask , if UAA students don't support their own sports teams , why should anyone else ?	0	0

eng_dev_2167	I think Oregon's collective bargaining statutes should be amended so that only pay and benefits are negotiated.  Things like teacher tenure and seniority provisions should be abolished so that school administrators can reward successful teachers and remove ineffective teachers.  School administrators should also be able to transfer teachers with special talents to positions of need regardless of their seniority.  We have allowed too much to go into these contracts with the teachers unions and we need to rethink our public policy on collective bargaining.  I'd advocate limits on collective bargaining with all public employees and would specifically limit police union contracts to issues of pay and benefits.	0	0

The bet on oil sands is binary - either wellhead prices exceed production costs + overhead, or they don't. Some investors may be willing to make this bet, perhaps arguing that the price paid for the assets (or the shares) already reflects an appropriate discount. But this bet assumes that reference crude prices i.e. WTI will rise considerably AND that the differential between oil sands wellhead prices and WTI will contract appreciably. Saudi Aramco will soon offer shares to the public and it will boast the lowest finding, development & lifting costs on the planet PLUS a quality premium for its crude. Not that they desire to, but we can assume that Shell would rather own shares in Aramco, even at a substantially higher valuation to oil sands operators.	0	0

eng_dev_2256	Singapore has health costs 4 to 5 times lower than ours, with better overall results.  How do they do it?  Simple: all hospitals are operated by government agencies, and most doctors are government employees.  The health ministry determines what these entities need to function well, and prohibits charging anything beyond that.  The consumer can self-insure--some do, because their costs are more manageable than ours--but most buy insurance policies, which of course have much lower premiums than ours do.  And Singaporeans are happy with their system, just like Canadians and British are happy with theirs.  Americans are alone as a wealthy country that can't control health care costs and won't guarantee care to all citizens.  It's a patchwork lottery.

Dominant high tech companies tend to remain dominant because they can roll out their platforms globally within days or weeks. They also have the funds for R&D, a big must. They also have the cash to purchase competitors or necessary additions to their R&D platforms. Witness the rush to buy AI firms recently, and firms like Apple have hundreds of billions of CASH to pay for them. It's next to impossible to be a little guy. If you are a supplier to a large High Tech firm you are almost certain to have your legs cut off at some point or at best your profit margins destroyed.

However, they're not doing the job of an ""Executive Director,"" and their experience is of limited value for a Mayor's tasks.  2. Vinis has no experience as an elected official, and it appears she hasn't had any occasion to ""lock horns"" with our City Manager and his staff. She simply has not demonstrated that she is adequately prepared to resist manipulation by the City Manager.  3. Lacking in relevant experience or even much exposure to city government, and seeming to have been picked as a proxy for another Piercy term, we can expect that Vinis will not sway from Piercy's agenda.

eng_dev_2374	It’s a question of resolving contradictions.     Just in the case of the first of the Dubia: The Church has taught in various documents (some listed by the Dominican priest) that persons who are validly married and who now live with another not as brother or sister but with sexual relations cannot receive communion.   Can they be absolved while they still are in this sinful state?  Crammed into a footnote (351) by Francis’s author of AL (Francis himself has said he doesn’t remember that footnote!!) seemingly allows for that second married couple to have intercourse and to have communion, without an annulment.   So how can established Church teaching and AL both be right?  Is Francis’s AL either a dismissal the prior teaching?  Or is AL actually a dismissal of the Law of Non-Contradiction?  Is prior Church teaching wrong?  How, precisely, can both be right?     It's odd that Francis won't address this contradiction.	0	0

He was Executive Director of the Goldwater Institute. His choice of title (and cover design) were quite deliberate.  He is very conservative on economic issues, but he is pro-immigration - sees immigrants as one of our nation's strengths (I agree), and supports a path to legal residency/citizenship.  He has been slammed by the extreme right for using the Goldwater legacy - he is just a ""slimey liberal"" in their minds, not worthy to call himself a follower of Goldwater.

The bill that was passed is completely different than the bill sent to the Hill by the Obama Administration. The original legislation was a single payer system, and was DOA due to objections from the GOP side of the aisle. They demanded and received an almost verbatim copy of the plan touted by the Heritage Foundation, the authors of the Massachusetts bill that Romney was proclaiming such a success during the last election cycle. The passage of the bill was subject to so many revisions that the final copy was rushed. At signing, the fact that this was a first try at a plan for the nation was talked about; the tragedy of it is that like most committee derived plans, it adequately solved few problems. Dropping it entirely will be difficult, amending it may be the best option at this point, save instituting a single payer plan, which has been proven to work.	0	0

Heck why stop there how about car salesmen, insurance salesman, homebuilder, airline ticket agent, cellphone provider, etc, etc.  Actually the problem here is quite nuanced.  There already is a best price standard which ensures clients always get the lowest price.  The problem with a fiduciary duty is that the regulators don't provide clear guidelines on how to meet this very high level of duty so it's basically a minefield of potential litigation.

eng_dev_2558	"Hi, BC Thoughts.   Like your post.  A lot.    The ""Canadian west"" has a bigger problem, I submit, than ""myth versus truth.""  The problem?  Nobody much cares. Also--perhaps--Canadians are secretly doubtful or downright embarrassed by their history, so myth-making was simply stifled.  No real vehicle (Hollywood industry) to do it, but even in around 1900--before movies--Canadian myth-making literature was in short supply, too.  No shortage of dime-novel--or Fenimore Cooper--stuff in the USA, though.  Many history books were written. Non-fiction isn't ""mythical.""  So, lets discount the many written by, say, Hugh Dempsey, who wrote to dispel myth.  He had an easy time of it.  Trouble was, few people read his books, either.   This exhibition proves the point.  I suspect most of the exhibits are of the American west. Even those from the Canadian west may have been created by Americans. Many NWMP paintings  (""Single-handed"" comes to mind) were created by Americans Russell and Remington."	0	0

IMO - no bill should be able to pass the House/Senate without at least 1/4 - 1/2 support from the opposition party.  There can still be a ""majority"", and as such, as the majority grows, the less people on the opposite side you would need support from in order to pass the legislation.

eng_dev_2637	To be fair many people have been trying to buy salt for weeks to no avail. My husband found one bag after a month of trying. It is more a failing of the supply chain of places like Canadian Tire Home Depot and Walmart than the city. The city is having to distribute salt because there is none in stores to buy. They also have the snow plows but they can't get down the side streets, which honestly is easy to solve by putting up no parking signs. But then you would see riots. 30 years ago snow plows were probably smaller. Its hard to buy small snow plows in a jiffy. But the city should probably keep a couple on hand.	0	0

If anything disrupts the flow of tourism in Hawaii, we will be at a huge loss depending on the severity.  Add to that we are literally thousands of miles from the mainland, so shipping goods and supplies will take a while.  We can airlift only so much.  Everyone needs to assume that a hurricane IS on the way and prepare appropriately.

What I didn't do was to whine about having to pay taxes or comply with regulations and filings, but I never found them to be that big of a deal for my company.   Actually one of the chemical business' better arguments was that it shouldn't be their job to pay for other's failures and mistakes.  That we under-regulated and let these weasels get away with it is more our fault than the others in the industry.

eng_dev_2669	The Paris Accord (PA) on global warming, concluded in December 2015, had been viewed as an enhancement of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol (KP).  But only some weeks later, the Supreme Court of the US (SCOTUS) effectively “killed” EPA’s “Clean Power Plan (CPP),” the centerpiece of the US commitment to the Paris Accord.   The CPP’s carbon regulation had been challenged by 27 states and an array of utilities, coal producers and business groups.  A SCOTUS’ February 9 “stay” overturned a DC Court of Appeals panel’s decision to allow the EPA plan to go forward. Although the appeals panel had not stayed CPP, it had established an expedited hearing schedule for the case, which is scheduled to begin on June 2.  After the plaintiffs lost their case in the Court of Appeals, they petitioned SCOTUS to issue a “stay,” citing the danger of “irreparable harm.”  The contributions are NOT binding as a matter of international law as per the PA!	0	0

Idaho has NEVER built a dam with a fish ladder,  and the four dams that block the Snake River from Hells Canyon to Ontario are private dams,  built by Idaho Power Company,  with the whole hearted support of former Senators Borah and Church.  It sickens me that Church has a USFS Wilderness named for him.  Extirpating salmon to Nevada and the totality of the Oregon, Idaho and Nevada waters above Hells Canyon Dam deserves a black mark of distain by his name.  I repeat:  Idaho has never built a dam with a working fish ladder for salmon.  That is why the Payette Lake sockeye run is long gone,  and Stinkingwater,  a major Malheur River tributary no lingers smells bad from decaying,  spawned out salmon.  Idaho sucks!	1	0

eng_dev_2747	On the grounds that there were about to be a couple thousand veterans standing with the protesters; that, given the brutal way they've been treated, they didn't want it exploding into any more of a media fiasco than it already is.  At first they tried jailing the media under false charges, until they beat it in court:  A clear indication they've got something to hide.  That something is the brutal way indigenous people, including elders, and protesters, have been treated by state and local authorities in this whole thing---A far cry from the handling of an armed take-over of a wildlife refuge by a bunch of rednecks.  The double standard here is breath taking	0	0
eng_dev_2748	Of course there is.  They both draw ATTENTION.  That was the whole point of the analogy.  How could you have possibly missed that after I pointed it out to you over and over?  And you know as well as I do that the protocol for standing for the national anthem is when you're present at the event where it's being played.  Not watching on TV at home.  Now, when I attend Bronco games, yes, I stand every time.  Answer me this... suppose for some reason Governor Hickenlooper were coming to your house.  When he enters the room, would you stand up as a sign of respect or not?    It's the exact same thing.  Protocol is to stand up out of respect.  NOT standing up is a sign of disrespect.	0	0

I've always disagreed with any ""sit-lie"" ban because what it does is just put one public area off limits for certain activities which means everywhere else NOT under a ""ban"" is fair game.  Instead, the law should be written in such a way that covers ALL public spaces in terms of what you can and cannot do.  Oh wait, there IS such a law already!

Best I can figure is that ABC Corp. leases space in a big room as opposed to a suite of offices? If that's the case, how does that help ABC  give its employees appropriate work space? And if it's people from several companies in one big room, how does ABC keep proprietary and confidential information from XYZ Inc.'s people? Don't they distract and interrupt each other?

Continuing with mega-projects -including the obscene Pipe Dream -- now those fall into the felonious dereliction of duty category. 15% of Fed.Inc Tax is not onerous & Pres.Trump plans to reduce FedInc tax. I favor a small Income Tax. A statewide Sales Tax is appropriate. Take time to read, understand the little book ""THE FAIR TAX"" The very poor need not be hurt. Attempting to buoy up the statewide economy by gubmut spending is as wrong-headed as mega-spending on an LNG line & dreaming of a miracle to make it profitable.

eng_dev_2865	It was one of my great peeves that I was a licensed Captain with a comprehensively equipped and superbly maintained 36' twin-engine boat, and at least until the cruise ship season got busy I could count on getting boarded and inspected every time I left Auke Bay.   That didn't bother me so much, but the fact that I watched 16 - 20 foot open skiffs with 8-10 people aboard and not a PFD in sight pulling out without the slightest attention from the Coast Guard bothered me a lot. Sorry, folks, but anybody carrying six people in an open boat in those waters is a reckless fool.   If you drown after going overboard, you weren't wearing a PFD.   I don't know that the people who died brought it on themselves, but if not the Captain killed them with his lack of skill and attention.  If you take people on your boat, their lives are your responsibility.	0	0

eng_dev_2947	On one front, it makes total sense: Ontario retail beer and liquor are comfortable with ongoing practices of encouraging conusmption of a commodity that is known to cause social ills. With cannabis, they can still push teh consumer good without the all that pesky guilt wrecking everyone's nap-time.  But an announcement does not an edifice make. Brick and mortar outlets won't be cheap, nor quick to appear. It's why an existing retailer (e.g. Shopper's, Brewer's Retail, etc.) makes more sense. But, as Gang of Four once said, it's (bureaucracies) not made for great men. Look for the province to push mail-order in the short-term, a garbage-heavy process (unrecyclable plastic, medical-grade packaging) with little redeeming social value (aside from props to Canada Post) and not much in the way of job creation (we're not talking 50,000 Amazon jobs here).

The left constantly race baits and classifies people in broad brush strokes based on race and religion. Remember ""white privilege""? Donald Trump didn't invent that concept. Everyday working Euro-Canadians are harried and harassed based on that concept. Another example, "" He says the voting system is “rigged,” while refusing to even entertain the possibility that the Kremlin... might have influenced the U.S. election."" Donald Trump was referring to the unbridled mainstream media bias in his accusation of the election being rigged. What did the left do after the election? Go nuts about recounts, Demand electors break their pledge and accuse Russia of effecting the outcome of the election.  Let's not forget as well that leftist thought control has always led to a one party system. The threat is clear and lucid voters elected Trump to remedy it."	1	0

""In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied.""   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children."	1	1

Success in football is a roller coaster ride at the mercy of dynamics like injuries, experience, recruits who do or don't pan out, and lucky bounces that come or don't come your way. Helfrich and his quality staff deserve the chance to weather this year's apparent storm, and they deserve the chance to develop the talent they have on this year's very young team.  Helfrich has been extremely successful, whether you want to give him the credit or not.  I'm with tompaine II, let's be patient and supportive, and if the Ducks continue the downward spiral next season, then it would be reasonable to talk about a new coach. Remember, a new coach is going to also mean a completely different system that will take time to succeed, as Coach Peterson has demonstrated at Washington.

If anything it will help Kanaka Maoli.  The TMT is not being built on any known burial ground, it will not contaminate any water (as testified to by a hydrology expert in the current contested case hearing), and it will prevent no one from carrying out their cultural practices.  It sits on 1% of the total science reserve and less than 1% of the entire mauna.  It is a telescope, not an oil pipeline.  The product of the telescope will not contaminate anything since that product is knowledge, freely available to all of humanity.  The only thing that might be harmed with the building of the TMT is the Hawaiian sovereignty movement, and that's not necessarily a bad thing if they are going to obstruct science with their politics.	0	0

If adapting to captivity so quickly didn't affect salmon species ability to successfully reproduce in the wild. If wild salmon and hatchery-raised salmon behaved the same way and were both as successful in the wild (wild fish are more successful at survival and reproduction). The proposed rules changes would impact both wild and hatchery-reared salmon populations. I note that your comment is pretty skeptical of numbers used in counting wild salmon, but you offer no alternative information.

Since the creation of the CCF in 1933, the CCF or NDP have contested  25 federal elections.Mulcairs 2015 total seat count was second best,with only the combined  Layton surge-Ignatieff wipe out better,at 103. Vote percentage wise, Mulcair's 2015 share of 19.71 percent was 3rd best--wih only 30.63 in 2011, and Ed Broadbent's 1988 share at 20.33 percent being higher.And in terms of funds raised, preparation, etc, the best ever. And only the second time the NDP won more than zero seats in Quebec.Not bad at all. Good for Mr. Mulcair. He was treated shabbily by the party, and by Mr.Broadbent in particular.And now what do we have...nothing to match Mr. Mulcair. Stupid stupid stupid stupid.Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb.	1	1

The first issue is overall immigration policy, which everyone seems to agree needs reform. Unfortunately, partisan divides have prevented both the Executive Branch and the Congress from coming up with and enacting reforms. Reforms in national policy need to address nuts and bolts issues such as what to do with DACA kids and with the 11 million illegal aliens currently in the country. No progress has been made on this ""big picture"" front. Secondly and separately is the current issue of who (refugees, green cardholders etc.) gets in based on national security concerns. The main issue seems to be concerns about the adequacy of current ""vetting"" procedures, hence the EO's temporary ban. Many presume that the current vetting process is defective.

eng_dev_3305	Feb 29th 1504 was a good day for Christopher Columbus too. For several months the famous explorer had been marooned on the island of Jamaica. He had been greeted warmly by the natives who helped him and his vast ship and crew survive in the foreign land by providing food and guides etc. However his arrogance and disrespect for the people had caused them to stop this gesture of goodwill. Cause, you know, he was being a dick.  Outraged by this, Columbus consulted his shipboard almanac to ask if there was anything he could use to trick the natives. As it happens, there was a lunar eclipse coming up. On the 29th feb, the day of the eclipse, he gathered the natives and told them that god was angry for their disrespect and would take away the sun. Disappearing inside his ship during the eclipse, he waited as the good people begged for their women and children. He agreed to 'bring the sun back', and essentially enslaved the people until he was rescued.  WHAT A DICK.  happy leap year	1	0

eng_dev_3337	Comment was not in regards to my personal situation in any way, which is just fine.  It was referencing the growing income and wealth disparity in Canada, which will lead to economic and societal failure sooner or later if not reined in.  Who do you think is going to be buying all the goods and services that generate the wealth for these rich business owners when working people no longer have sufficient disposable income to do that, and are loaded with debt?  That is rapidly becoming the reality in Canada, and it will not lead to a functional economy and prosperity for the country.	0	0
eng_dev_3338	"Things I don't understand: bringing back Osweiler instead of just naming Sloter #2-#3; cutting Ward (I could have seen TRADING Ward, but cutting him a year early seems self-destructive for the locker room); playing Leary at right guard instead of left; starting Max Garcia at all; keeping Cody Latimer.   I know the 53 is a collaboration between who the coaches want and how Elway wants the roster constructed, but its becoming clear to me that part of the appeal of Vance Joseph to Elway was that he could have more direct influence on roster construction and less push back with a first time head coach.  Elway loves his draft picks and will give them more chances than they probably deserve, but he better improve his batting average because free agents are NOT going to want to come here if its going to be ""Patriots West"" but without a franchise QB."	0	0

eng_dev_3346	Canada is developing a track record for opposing the will of free peoples in preferring the notion of outside interference 'helping' them express themselves. Recently Canada lauded the 'outcome' of a world-wide plebiscite of Venezuelans calling for the overthrow of their curent, legitimately elected government and decried as 'illegal' a similar, recorded,  exercise by far more Venezuelans, in Venezuela, a week later.   This follows on our instant recognition of a (US-sponsored)  anti-government coup in Ukraine,  followed by the denial of the rights to self-determination of people in some parts of that country. By the same token, our government has undertaken to 'fight ISIS' in Syria and to support effecting a (US inspired, supplied and supported)  'regime change'  in the current,  democratically-elected government.   I guess somebody was 'called in' to see 'the ambassador'.	0	0

But Freeland is (if memory serves) half Ukrainian and was personally invested in the issue.  Regardless, she was the only Liberal who risked her promotion opportunities by being principled on the thuggish Putin's exploitation of American weakness under Obama to seize Ukraine.  Liberals, you see, rarely put principle before promotion or profit and under Junior this is even more the case.    Junior would not have faced Putin and told him to get out of Ukraine as Harper did but rather would have moved in for the smiling two handed handshake followed by a selfie.

One example is  he is going to get rid of the 35 hour week, and undo some of the damage created by the socialists. While those dependent on the state may well go to the side of Mme. Le Pen, on balance it would seem that those in France who want to see the country survive and improve will be in the majority in a runoff between Marine et François. M. Fillon is said to be an anglophile, with a Welsh wife and five offspring ( no doubt they are all more bilingual than the top civil servants here in Ottawa); Fillon, sparkles on a personal scale and has mass appeal.

eng_dev_3398	One thing that happens at every hydro project that you only hear about decades later is the fact that landowners forced off their property never get lake from property that is eventually as good as gold. The developers always keep that for themselves to sell off years down the road. For example; a 1 acres lake front lot in the lower 48 sold for $6000 during the lake fill up period that took years and 40 years later sold for $450,000. The lake with 500 miles of shore line carries the local economy of the area to this day. Simply put, the value of the dam can not be measured simply in electrical costs. So when you look at the costs versus benefits, you have to look at both sides of the coin. If the dam is built; the displaced people should get a fair share of lake front as compensation in addition to what they get from eminent domain proceedings. And maybe free electricity for life or forever. You must also use the future value of the land for just compensation. Lake front is the $prize	0	0

Where has been the tight labour market that is supposed to raise real wages (instead of introducing neo-slavery thorugh the temporary foreign worker program)?

Who is going to put it all together and get a majority onboard? Why were these topics never discussed in the mayoral campaign, but just values statements?  Is the progressive majority (of which I'm apart) capable of overcoming idealism for the sake of pragmatism? What areas can we compromise on? What areas are we not compromising on?

What he did was VERY stupid but I don't think that sexting with someone is worth prison time, shunning from your family, needing to inform your neighbors you are a sex offender and the inability to find a job. Part of the problem with 18 year olds being in high school with 14 year olds is the likliehood that this will occur, and it does all the time without being reported. It's easy to delete messages and make someone look in the wrong and generally speaking the girl is believed above the guy because no one wants to make it seem they don't think rape or coercion is a big deal. I would be willing to bet there was something mutual going on here. You do not get a persons phone number and send them messages like that without some idea that they will be reciprocated.	1	0

Then one of he guys spoke up and said,  ""Yea, that's me."" His friends turned and looked at him all puzzled. ""what ?"" He said, ""I got 5 kids. We looked into it and we qualify for section 8 housing and food stamps, but i neva like sign up"" His friends were blown away and i think all re-evaluated their view of what low income is.

eng_dev_3467	"The United States Constitution is a system of basic laws and principles that defines the rights of American citizens and sets limits on what the government can and cannot do. It's a living document that must beinterpreted in the context of the times in which it is applied and also in the context of the time in which it was crafted:  The Constitution was written after a hard-won war for freedom and independence to end control by the oppressive governance of England. It was intended to ensure the people's right to defend itself against government overreach, to deter undemocratic or oppressive governing bodies from forming, to repel impending invasions, suppress insurrection, participate in and uphold the law, enable citizens of the United States to organize a militia and to facilitate the ""natural right to sel-defense."" Thus I am fairly certain that the second amendment was not put in place to allow anyone to commit mass murder against innocent United States citizens in times of peace."	0	0

eng_dev_3469	Long time military family, this US code is for military ceremony's in fact just did it for a WW 2 vets recent memorial which was a different code of regulations, led by the VFW when it comes to honoring the vets service  (and the exact words said by a members leading the service are in the regulations) as is the folding of the flag and the gun salute. The military has a strict code of conduct for ceremony's involving the US Flag. One I adhere to is the collection of tattered and used American flags for proper burning and disposal by the VFW. I collect them from people who allow me to properly dispose of them by handing them over to the VFW post.

Obviously not everyone is going to earn 12% (I personally have earned just over 9% annualized over the past 25+ years).

eng_dev_3493	Many of the most ardent opponents of continued mass immigration - especially illegal immigration - are those who arrived here through legal means many years ago. Unlike the gate-crashers who are being mollycoddled by Mr. Sunny Ways & Company, the vast majority of immigrants and real refugees who arrived here in earlier times played by the rules. Given that they were expected to support themselves and that they received minimal help from any level of government, their resentment toward today's legions of  international welfare and benefit shoppers is completely understandable. Don't take my word for it however. Talk with some of the immigrants who arrived here a few decades ago and ask them for their opinions. You won't like what you hear.	0	0

On the ocean bottom just offshore, what used to be a kelp-covered expanse of cobbles habitat for crabs and the forage fish (sand lance, surf smelt) has now be been formed. Forage fish are important to salmon runs both in the local area of the Elwha and in the rest of the Strait. It will take time, but salmon will re-establish above the old dam sites. They've already started.  As to changing the way we elect our presidents, I didn't see that mentioned in the article and I don't know if your assertion is true.	0	0

Up until 2014, Eugene averaged one homicide per year. Since the beginning of 2014, we've had seventeen, a nearly six-fold increase. The Whiteaker, once a quirky neighborhood of former hippies and wannabes, has been averaging over a dozen shootings per month since the drug dealer, who serviced the homeless and their endless appetite for drugs, was murdered. St. Vinnie's authorized camp in Alton Baker has had two murders in eight months.  How long will this go on and how far will it go? Portland allowed open camping on the Springwater bike path until the violence got so bad they finally had to end their virtue signaling and evict the squatters. Many of these violent folks have ended up on our bike paths.  This latest armed robbery may not be a homeless person. However, we have now developed a culture of violence thanks to them.	0	0

The city and state could do absolutely nothing and eventually, the technology for driverless cars will mature and be significantly a lot cheaper by then allowing for mass deployment of such cars which would significantly reduce the amount of traffic because we would no longer be at the mercy of traffic caused by those that should not have a license to begin with since they have poor judgment or drive very slow.  Rubbernecking would be eliminated because any cars that are stalled would instantly communicate to other cars that there is a stalled car and the rest of the cars would automatically and efficiently go around the stalled car.  We could provide a $1,000 tax credit to 1 Million drivers and that would still be $9 Billion cheaper than the current rail system.  (cont)	0	0

eng_dev_3584	This proposal is unprecedented. No such regulations exist ANYWHERE in the USA. In fact, the proposal was put forth by the Wild Sheep Foundation, which cooperated with USDA and ADF&G in 2012 to make a lot of recommendations for the management of wild-to-domestic goat/sheep interactions.  Notice that the overwhelming portion of this document focuses on grazing on public lands: A practice that (to my knowledge) does not exist here AT ALL. This tells me that the risk of such transmissions is actually very unlikely.  How often do Alaskan farmers notice a wild ram/billie checking out their fenced ewes/nannies?  So the Wild Sheep Foundation is focusing on the least of the management strategies. And this is a lightly masked effort they're making to establish a legal precedent that can be carried to other states.  It's a BIG violation of private land use and everyone should be pissed.

eng_dev_3609	One thing to bear in mind in the debate over church and state is that Canada is not 'Murica.  America was established with the idea of separation of church and state clearly entrenched in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  It is based on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution which declares that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”   Thomas Jefferson promoted the idea of such separation and in 1947, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black quoted Jefferson in his majority opinion for Everson v. Board of Education declaring that “the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect ‘a wall of separation between Church and State.'”  Many Canadians erroneously believe that separation of church and state is guaranteed in the Canadian Constitution. When, in fact, Canada constitutionally accommodates religion in ways that would never be accepted in the United States.	0	0

Today's kids don't care if they kill someone or not.  Bad parents and public schools teaching our kids nothing about respect and values is adding to our problems . In conclusion , gays had nothing to do with this shooting .

Now we are responsible for making sure our children are not abused sexually? NO! this is the responsibility of the system to make sure our children have a chance in life. A pedophile can not and will not stop abusing. By releasing these people, its an endangerment to the community, they will never stop abusing because they are mentally unable. When this judge sentences this man for attacking these pedophiles, I hope he knows that this man never had a chance at life to be who he could be.	0	1

eng_dev_3674	Attention Washington Examiner:  Let me educate you on what you think you know! Contrary to popular belief the definition of a machine gun has NOTHING to do with how fast, or slow the gun empties a magazine, and is only defined by trigger mechanics. A semi-automatic firearms rate of fire is only limited by how fast the person pulls the trigger. Bump fire is a symptom of a semi-automatic mode. Machine guns when in semi-automatic mode can be bump fired. Devices on the market do not cause semi-automatic firearms to bump fire, they merely makes the firearm easier to be bump fired. So if a semi-automatic firearms rate of fire is not mechanically limited, the devices that are purposed to be banned would include my trigger finger.	0	0

The point you included that one is not intentional and the other is to tenderize the meat is what makes one more evil.  In the West, we have the right to protest, to write articles, expose what the industry hides.  In contrast, China is a communist country where its citizens are stripped of the right to protest, the one to speak out is the one that risks their life as they too will be put in the same cage as the ill-fated stolen pet.

eng_dev_3697	In 2015, Kirk went in for a  GET extension and was given what he wanted, plus 900 million more.  He assured the legislature that he had more than enough to finish the rail.   Less than 6 months later, he was back asking for more.     I know Senator Tokuda took a stance to not further extend the GET anymore, but seriously, it runs until 2037 or so.   Since the GET is regressive ad hurts the poor and working class the most, getting some relief 20 years later is no help.  In the meantime, the city raised gas taxes which also hurts the poor and working class and soon enough, property taxes will get hit up for either the next shortfall, or for O&M of the rail, but most likely it will be hit up for both, causing rents to go up, and again, hurting the poor and working class.  And all this is running concurrently while we continue to pay the extra GET, drive on crappy roads, kids roasting in school, record homeless, and traffic continues to get worse, train or not.	0	0

eng_dev_3721	I think both the comments of 'Molson Light' and 'J. Flames' are valid.  There are people without the mental aptitude, health or physical ability to make it in today's society.  But a program like this also creates a disincentive.  It's not so much that people are lazy, but some able-bodied, healthy people, to put it politely, are willing to work, but not at any job that they could actually get. But that's why a pilot study is good.  I'd be curious to see how well people on a guaranteed income versus traditional welfare transition over a period of years in terms of dependency, personal welfare and self-sustainability.  There may well be a 'net benefit' to society in terms of the cost of this versus other programs.  And, it's also been shown that giving money to people who spend it, versus stick it in the bank, provides a boost to the economy.	0	0

It was the Harper government’s decision, from 2008 to 2015, to ignore the Charter of Rights, the Supreme Court of Canada, and Canada’s obligation to rehabilitate child soldiers. Khadr’s lawsuit would have succeeded eventually, probably costing Ottawa a lot more than $10.5-million. It is black and white that his rights were abused.

A system called ""rotation"" was instituted whereby we changed classrooms several times a day in order to be taught by specialists in mathematics and the sciences, in addition to other subjects. And this system of teaching continued throughout the 8th grade, after which we moved on to high school where specialized teaching had long been the norm. So it can be done. The interesting thing is that I never lost my basic numeracy skills and when working could easily solve problems that involved utilizing basic algebra.

eng_dev_3917	"Respectfully EISOLON, at it's inception, the ACA was set up to give federal tax money to the states, which ends up in the private insurers pockets, these subsidies are only temporary and by design scheduled to cease at a point in time, shifting the full burden financially to the states, who expanded the Medicaid rolls to record numbers as the ACA also accommodated by design.     Then on top of this by design, they create a forced mandate which the Supreme Court upheld as a ""tax"", thus we must pay a ""tax"" aka what was once known as premiums to private insurers, just to maintain their solvency in this new health care system. Then the private insurers keep raising this ""tax"" aka premiums on the people with the government's blessing, while some of us are trying to figure out how congress was given the constitutional power to delegate to a massive private industry the power to tax the people, all by design to begin with, long before Mr. Trump inherited this huge mess!

eng_dev_3939	This article is not a parochial one about Hawaii. It refers to development of online schools nation-wide. There is a big problem that mostly involves things that aren't happening. for example: There is little effective K12 regulation since there is very little, in fact almost no, research about how online education should be delivered, what are the standards that ought to apply to online K12 pedagogy, what are the modalities of instruction that correlate with learning. There is little agreement about how to teach people to teach and students to learn online. The people in charge of overseeing and regulating online instruction don't really understand how it should work and in most cases, have never taught or learned online themselves.	0	0

However, I think you are not on the money re Trudeau, although I am not sure what you mean exactly, and I am not familiar with the Trudeau quote or context.  I suspect that what Trudeau meant was that Canada's formal policy of multiculturalism, a policy adopted when his father was PM, defines Canada differently than most nations. Although we have our fair share of xenophobes, the overwhelming majority of Canadians embrace diversity; and dissenting voices among politicians and leaders are few and far between.

eng_dev_3960	I'd suggest you look at the State of Texas as a prime example of wind not only at par but below cost of gas or coal fired plants.  Without subsidies of any kind.  That's where renewables are at and heading steadily lower.  Uptake has blown the feds estimate out of the water long before they predicted it would occur.  Coal is a dead industry walking and while gas has a real place in the sun it's days will be numbered as well.  Just not tomorrow. And I never said FIW was profitable; it was too early, the location in Alaska had an impact and it is competing with brand new gas fired cogen facilities.  I am willing to do a part though as the process has to start somewhere.  I'd even pay your FIW cost if CEA had a mechanism to do so, plus a couple more.  If each of us US citizens just did enough to reduce one pound of CO2 per day that would amount to 300 million pounds plus eliminated.  Rather impressive in my book.	0	0

By voting out any of your own legislators that are in the majority.  Even though they might be reasonably good reps, if they're in the majority, they're part of the problem because they empower the likes of Chenault and his cronies.

For seven years, every time they repeated the mantra “Repeal and Replace”, Republicans were lying: they had no plan to replace the ACA. The farce they are voting on today was cobbled together in haste. Conservatives don’t like it because it doesn’t hurt enough people; too many people will still have insurance. Liberals don’t like it because it will hurt so many people -- 24 million people will lose their health insurance.  Trump promised that his health plan (as though he ever had one!) would cover everyone (universal health care!) for less money and provide better care than the ACA, and that the transition from the ACA would happen simultaneously, seamlessly He was lying.  Ryan promised that when the Republicans replace the ACA, no-one, not one American, will be worse off than under the ACA. He was lying.	0	0

Tell children a stranger will dislike or hate them, and on meeting the stranger, the children will act in ways that earn dislike. HS rebels need rejection to rebel against, and provoke it for attention.   Tell visitors their destination’s filled with people who already dislike or hate them. The visitors will interpret everything they experience as proof they do.  And reciprocate in ways that earn the dislike that wasn't there to begin with  And humans reflexively ""Mirror"" to fit in.  Try it.  Most people can't help smiling back, when smiled at. Or returning a disgusted look with another.  So if visitors weren't told to expect dislike they might not find it.

All things being equal, that the person appointed be  well equipped by education and experience to do the job, why shouldn't the government appoint friends.

The problem arises when as the editorial points out you appoint a friend, a failed Liberal politician, and double the salary all this after coming to power claiming to be above such practices.

The debate hasn't ever been about whether or not human activity has an effect on the climate, nor even if the climate is once again changing; the debate, when intentional mischaracterization isn't on the agenda, is whether or not our activity is the cause of such change, whether or not our effect on the climate is worth restructuring the economic activity of an entire planet and if we were to lessen the effect we have if that would even have a noticeable impact upon the change in the climate.  I mean, let's be honest. Between climate changes and evolution only around 3% of the species that have ever existed on the planet still exist on the planet. The other notable reality is that the planet has gone through climate changes far greater than the doomsday scenario portrayed today and the planet is still here, still supporting life.  What people are really afraid of is joining the 97% of species that aren't here.	0	0

They still get paid as AD's of the school and get a extra trip to Waikoloa to ""discuss"" what they want to do although I'm sure they already knew going into the meeting while they were on Oahu. But if its true that they always complain about money, then don't support them and let them ""starve on the vine"".  No interest equals to no money.

The OIA's behavior is understandable in light of the reality that the playing field in Hawaii high-school football is not level, any more than it is in college football.  Hawaii also has its ""haves"" and ""have-nots"", and the ""haves"" are the ILH schools with the money and facilities and coaches to cherry-pick top athletes from all over the state, which they do actively and successfully.  The OIA can't change this, but what it can do (and I expect will continue to do) is resist any restructuring of in-season or post-season competition that allows more than one ILH team to reach the state championship game.  History has shown that in most years there is no more than one public school team that can succeed against the ILH elite, and so it makes sense for the OIA to oppose any arrangement that could require the best OIA team to beat two ILH teams to win a title."	0	0

Given that federal revenue transfers to Provincial Governments (and transfers by the Federal & Provincial Governments to Local Governments) have tended to fall in real terms over recent decades, these general transfer adjustments should be modest.	0	0

They feel disenfranchised and outside society.  Not necessarily because of racism, but just as well because they believe in jihad. So how can we say that they are even English when nothing they do or say or believe in has anything to do with English values as we know them.  As we even know English values as Canadians.  As we are part of the Commonwealth  this also touches us.  And we should care when people who have been welcomed into a country flaunt their hatred like these terrorists do.

eng_dev_4317	The leverage cycle, that has only worsened since the financial crisis, coupled with structural unemployment, are the two key economic challenges in the West - (US, Canada, UK, EU)  Politicians of all stripes are reticent to address either however,  as they rely on borrowing to win votes on the one hand, and promising to reverse job losses in manufacturing on the other, carefully avoiding blaming the unemployed themselves.  Honestly addressing these two issues, with unskilled workers taking some responsibility for their plight, is essential in moving forward.  This is especially true in an upward rate environment, with higher interest costs.  That stock volatility and  direction will be affected in the first 100 days is less certain as a strong Dollar, few attractive investment alternatives and a world of index huggers and crowded trades looks to persist.

Polynsaturated oils spoil very easily and generate free radicals when heated, and so can be a big part of the reason for inflammation that leads to heart disease.	0	0

eng_dev_4377	I do not know if I know ‘the’ right question but in general better questions are formed when they look at fundamentals which sometimes are board.  From there more specific questions can be asked with care not to introduce unnecessary assumptions. Circular reasoning or Petitio Principii must be avoided. Many of the posters attempt to disprove a large body of scientific fact with a limited potentially discrepancy which is where Kim80 started but finished with little rational argument. In this particular case with coffee being harmed by AGW a number of things can be asked as we must as for adaptations to AGW everywhere. One question is whether we want to continue or expand coffee production? Then we can ask what are the best characterists? But I think asking what are the environmental consequences should be a priority. Considering factors like land clearing, fertilizer, pesticide use, and long term employment. I think AGW is a big problem that will not be solved by traditional methods.	0	0

The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly characterized the authority of the state legislatures over the manner of awarding their electoral votes as ""plenary"" and ""exclusive.""  The normal way of changing the method of electing the President is not a federal constitutional amendment, but changes in state law.   Historically, major changes in the method of electing the President have come about by state legislative action. For example, the people had no vote for President in most states in the nation's first election in 1789. However, now, as a result of changes in the state laws governing the appointment of presidential electors, the people have the right to vote for presidential electors in 100% of the states."	0	0

eng_dev_4382	It is strange behaviour on the part governments, when they celebrate our diversity, our multiculturalism and equality for all, yet are quite fine that aboriginals remain outside all of this. Governments are  quite content to cede millions of hectares to aboriginal and Inuit control, while turning a blind eye to the right of individuals on this land to have any from of ownership. These same governments continue to dole out billions to aboriginals and Inuit every year, which gives them special status over every other Canadian. Your ancestral lineage that connects you in some way to aboriginals or Inuit, should not be advanced with the purpose of adding even more people to be able to claim benefits. Doing so flys in the face of the whole notion of a just society, as no society should place or single out one group for special treatment simply because of bloodlines however great or small.  One can only imagine what it does to your pride to be dependent on government for your very existence.	0	0

eng_dev_4404	Lynn,  I am aware of this work and I applaud it.  I have a problem with the city manager and council that have consistently placed these homeless camps in the Whitaker and now possibly in Santa Clara, these are not the wealthiest or most influential people in this town.  Instead of really trying to spread it around, the city has taken a rather easy way out.    A follow-up to my earlier post--why not again use the money that has been earmarked for the city hall to help move the dial on the homeless situation.  My well-founded, I think, fear is that the city council will be perfectly happy adding more and more of these camps in the city.  If there are 3000 homeless people and each camp housed 20, we are talking about 150 or more camps.  They seem to be ignoring the true seriousness of this situation.  They could still build the city hall--just send the measure to the voters--like they should have from the start.  Or they could keep increasing the stormwater fee, to pay for it.	0	0

eng_dev_4467	It's sadly true to form for the PC party to oppose Tory's modest user-pay proposal for the Gardiner and DVP without offering any credible alternative.  Mr. Brown's predecessor from the Niagara region was a Ford Nation cars and subways man, against all expert advice.  Now we have another rural PC party leader  weighing in on Toronto's mobility mess.  I get the political calculus: add voters from 905 and the kind of 416 people who support Mammoliti to the bedrock rural base, and the PC's have themselves a government to play with.  But the actual policy stinks.  GTA transportation planning has been dominated by suburban populists for so long that we are now approaching a mobility crisis in our region.  By  opposing Tory's baby step on tolls, Brown has signalled that the Wynne government - with all its many faults - is the only credible choice for any voters who care about the quality of life in the GTA.	0	0
eng_dev_4468	The countdowns should be moved to above the intersection and hooded, those are for drivers. They should be precise. The arterial routes should be for cars only, not for bikes or skateboarding. The streetcars do not belong on Toronto streets, phase them out and replace them with buses. Pedestrians who enter the intersection on red and block the turning vehicles should be heavily fined. All bike routes, whenever possible, should run one block off the main streets. All the construction access should be allowed only from the back streets/laneways.  Choke points like the bottom of Spadina need to be redesigned. That's just bare bones. We have sixties infrastructure and we're surprised we have gridlock. We don't build mass transit, but we expect people to leave their cars.  We build massive suburbs, farther and farther away and expect families to bike it. We're a stupid, stupid people.	1	1

eng_dev_4570	"Hello Pete,  My subject was Vancouver, and the extremely high house prices there ARE the result of a flood of overseas money flooding in since the late 1980s, mainly from rich folks born and raised in Hong Kong and mainland China. That mechanism is the reason that houses in Vancouver skyrocketed to dozens of times the average annual local income in Vancouver. That mechanism is the reason why a small house on a small lot in Vancouver sells for two million dollars.  You pretend that my recognition of facts and reality is somehow ""racist"".   Nope, it is not racist to recognize reality. Canada COULD have accepted the same number of immigrants from Hong Kong and China but in economic groups similar to those in Canada: many lower middle class, many middle class, some poor, a few very rich. That would have been excellent and house prices in Vancouver would not have skyrocketed. But instead Canada selected for ultra-rich millionaires, resulting in two million dollar little bungalows."	0	0

Perhaps what is needed is a re-examination of the definition of health.  Spending in Canada is about 6K/person.  But for those 85 - 89, it is roughly 25K.  I hate to sound insensitive, but people in that age group are less likely to regain significant quality of life through aggressive treatment.  And with people like me aging, it will become unsustainable under just about any model.  Should palliative care only be offered after a certain age?  A tough question.

That's why the existing data is insufficient to determine impacts on human health.  The head honchos of the big ag corporations who are making the big decisions for their operations in Hawaii surely don't live downwind of their fields where restricted use pesticides are being applied.  No one wants to poison the land, but different people have different ideas about what constitutes poisoning and what constitutes unacceptable risks.  Big ag corporations are, of course, biased.  It's the people who are at risk of harm who are opposed to the way big ag corporations are using restricted use pesticides.  If those corporations want to be good neighbors, they should fund studies to generate the data necessary to draw valid conclusions about the effects of their pesticide use on people and the environment.	0	0

eng_dev_4772	You want proof? I switched to being a private investor this year. Started selling my funds at the end of January: put more than 1/2 the money in high interest savings and term deposits and invested the rest in equities, starting in May.

For fun, I check the performance of my old funds on a daily basis. Here's where things stand today, 4 months after taking the plunge: 1) my old TFSA fund, 1.33% YTD; my new TFSA, 6.51%; 2) my old RRSP fund, 0.76 % YTD; I have two new RRSPs: one in a savings account at @ 2.10%, the other invested in the market is at 3.21%: the plan is to invest more in equities as I gain more experience; 3) my old RRIF fund is at minus 0.30% YTD; my new RRIF is earning 2.40%.

eng_dev_4788	The truth is always somewhere in the middle.  Its true that if you go to rural areas you hear all kinds of things with populist appeal.   But thats LOCAL CBC, not national CBC.  The problem with the CBC is there is no way to actually affect what is going on.  So the choice becomes either live with it, or try to do away with it completely.        Getting rid of it isn't a great idea.  In New Brunswick the Irving family owns ALL the print media.  This family pretty much OWNS the province, and if there is ever a story on them, which there often is, the CBC is the only place you hear it.        However, even if you like a TV show, its still just a TV show.  Clearly some changes need to be made, while I like the idea of CBC, it gets harder and harder to defend it against some attacks.

And now younger people pay taxes for national parks they have no time to use.    The only reason user fees are charged at all is because the federal government chooses not to fully fund the upkeep of the properties they own, nor do they charge concessionaires adequate  fees for making money on federal land.   By your standards, we should start charging user fees for public schools to make sure users pay their fair share, instead of making those places free.	0	0

In attempting to isolate Public opinion and feedback to the people they the public put in those positions is a brazen but sad comment on just how much public input is valued within that Council.To somehow imply, as Gase is quoted above, that a complaint about Council conduct at a Public meeting - which is akin to an employee meeting with his or her Boss - is frivolous is both insulting and worrisome to the Boss. Any Public employee who has no time for his or her Boss will not last long on the job. This alone points out the best reason to return PA to its former style of governing, as it puts more power back into the hands of the Public, where it belongs. It's also the reason the City is dragging their feet getting the ballot language written since it seems clear from their previous behavior they don't want Citizens involved at times.	0	0

The Globe won't talk about Europe's failed policies because it generates ""irrational"" concern. Open borders are not popular. The Globe is wilfully ignorant to the views held by the majority of Canadians with respect to border controls and immigration screening. Everyone can see the media's bias staring them in the face on a daily basis. A recent example is the mainstream media's reaction to Trump's comments on Sweden over the weekend (his tweets normally appear as rambling unfiltered word clouds with an unknown context often related to a cable tv program he disagrees with, however, Sweden's issues with migrants aren't a secret (60 minutes)) - the irony is that there were riots in Sweden last night - the Globe's failure to report that story only increases Trump's support, even if the unrest was simple coincidence."	0	0

eng_dev_4854	Your tax dollars hard at work buying votes for Democrats. 99% of evictions are because either A) a tenant has not paid their rent or B) they are a nuisance or dangerous to other tenants. Providing them free legal counsel will only result in increasing costs for landlords - thus driving up rents. Ultimately it will make it more difficult for borderline candidates to rent an apartment. Landlords will demand higher credit scores, a more stable job history and higher security deposits. Ironically this proposal will speed up gentrification as landlords become more selective to whom they rent. Some chose to sell, resulting in the bulldozing of older, more affordable housing stock.   Landlords hate evictions - they are expensive. Lawyers don't work for free. An eviction ensures that any unpaid back rent is lost. Contrary to what Hancock and Co. seem to believe there is no advantage to evicting a tenant.   Can rent control be far behind if Denver has reached this level of stupid?	1	0

The athletic program cost in ASD simply do not exist in most non-public schools with multiple options for every student.     You point out the private school range in tuition is $ 6,000 to $ 17,000.  Yet you did not indicate the average cost. Nor did you reflect the range of grade levels of those private schools. What is the enrollment of special needs students in the private schools.  Factors that would change your financial analysis rapidly.  I know many parents whose children attend private schools.

There is more to this than either of us can cover in such a short space. But one of my thesis projects involved pollutant reducing fuel additives and I am quite familiar with this area.  A more complete picture would recognize that TEL was also removed from gasoline in the U.S. to enable catalytic converter technology. Yes, there was concern about environmental lead, but TEL is still used all over the world in aviation gasoline, as well as in gasoline in many countries. In fact, Innospec, based in Englewood, is a major supplier.  On CO2's impact on global warming (which began about 300 years ago), even the IPCC is lowering the estimates of its sensitivity.	0	0

eng_dev_5115	Billy you are making way too many assumptions based on practices from maybe one or two agencies. We have to work 25 years now to get full retirement (medical and 57.5% of our high 3 years). If we get out at 20 we get no medical and only 45% of our high three. (thats tier 2 and 3) Tier one cops are all gone. Tier 4 is the new 401K folks.  As for overtime I agree that the system has been gamed. The problem being that private companies like the sullivan areana have been allowed to pay for police overtime gigs but they don't pay for the retirement implications. However that is one agency in the state. My retirement when I hit 25 will not be enough to live on in Alaska and I will have to move or get another job.  Also its true if you eliminate the medical costs which has been done in Tier 4 the costs is the same if you had a 401K plan or a defined benefit plan.  Its actually costing the state more to screw workers over as less and less people are paying into the old plan causing deficits.	0	0

The developed world has gone on a crash diet while China feasts, and to add insult to injury we have agreed to ship billions of dollars to China on an annual basis with no commitment from them to reduce emissions.  While Trump may be a bad politician, he is a business man. I do not blame him for following through on his campaign promises.	0	0

Hillary lost the election and probably would have with or without Russian participation (the question is not if they succeeded, but the fact they tried).  Racism has been in this country since day one, much more so than it is today.

It's still highly likely you won't hit the target under stress, but if down to the last resort - as you described it, it maybe the only option left.  I'm not at all confident that many gun owners wouldn't freeze or make an error.    My Iowa friends got cheap carry permits and it only took about 2 hours, including the lesson and the written test.  Police train every year, many times a year.   It's not enough, all gun owners should have to demostrate competance.  That's a bare minimum.  People like the allusion of 'safety' with a gun.   But as my father in law used to say, when your number comes up, it's up.     You may improve your odds a tiny bit, but considering the odds of being shot are very low, it's not likely.

eng_dev_5216	"So essentially the Conservatives have learned NOTHING from the RINOs in the US election.

But I sometimes think that the people we should despise most of all are the squishes who pretend to be on our side of the argument but betray it. They do this by throwing the more outspoken among us to the wolves in order to signal how virtuous they are; sometimes they do this by endorsing some fatuous liberal position in order to show their willingness to compromise.  I call the latter approach the “dogshit yogurt fallacy.”  If conservatives like fruit in their yogurt and liberals prefer to eat it with dogshit, it is NOT a sensible accommodation to say: “All right. How about we eat our yogurt with a little bit of both?""    The liberal left never compromise, but for some reason conservatives are expected to."	0	0

eng_dev_5260	How is this different from the thousands of junked, occasionally burned cars littering the rural roads on every island? The counties have the registration information for these hulks, but don't chase down the registered owners and make them pay for collection of the junk.  The reason the attorneys want the wreck collected is to have better evidence that mechanical failure was the problem. I don't think they can hire someone to move private property they don't own off of state lands, and even if they could, it would be expensive, especially if the owner doesn't have any insurance.  Seems odd that anyone would be afraid of a plane, weighing less than a Toyota Tacoma, slamming into a residential building. On those rare occasions when that has happened (Cory Lidle in Manhattan), the plane usually bounces off the building and crashes to the street below.

A cut back in city personnel or layoffs is akin to political suicide. The state is broke and a city wide sales tax is DOA.   The profitable looking non-profits pay no land tax.

Every time there was a car accident that needed investigation; a fire; a water main break; road construction; or anything else that required a road closure, the line came to a dead halt.  There are no alternatives when a street level system cannot move forward.  These trains also must stop for all red lights, slowing progress.

So if you are going to take down statues to Lee, Jackson an other Southern leaders, generals or politicians because they own slaves [which was legal, not right but legal at that time] you had better start taking down almost ever statue in Washington DC and the rest of the US, renaming the streets/roads/turnpikes/schools and one hell of a lot of things in the US.  Just suck it up, it happened, nothing can be done to change the past, just hope the current conduct of some Americans does not lead to another civil war about race.

eng_dev_5336	I'm sure kids will still be able to get pot before they turn 18 or 19, just as I had little trouble getting booze (or indeed pot if I wanted it) when I was a teenager in high school.  And your point is what, exactly?  Legalization isn't likely to make pot any more or less widely accessible than it is today.  Kids who want to get pot can get it easily today, despite it being illegal.  Legalizing it will have no change on that.  As for adults, I suspect most will buy the legal stuff, even if it is taxed, simply for convenience.  It really isn't that hard to make your own booze today, but few people buy or sell alcohol without going through legal channels.  Lots of people, myself included, make alcohol at home and I'm sure lots of people will grow their own pot, but I doubt many people will bother selling it illegally.	0	0

eng_dev_5402	Eh, you're both right.  Federal law is typically overriding, but the state has the power to refuse to expend state/local resources to enforce federal law. In this case, Alaska repealed the state prohibition, but Federal law is still supreme, therefore, yes Marijuana is still TECHNICALLY illegal, and the feds could make a stink.  All Alaska did was say that the state and local governments don't have a mandate under state law to expend resources on investigating and prosecuting marijuana, and that local governments could choose to enact their own rules in certain areas (marijuana commercialization etc). Therefore, the Feds have all the responsibility to deal with marijuana that is legal under state/local law, which the Feds have said is really not something they care to take on because of the manpower and entanglements that it would create. They'll focus on obviously illicit, large issues and the state/locals can still support anti-drug work that violates state law.	0	0

Why enlarge the emptiness of the suggestion to change if most don't want change. Though I voted for Hillary, I accept the outcome, according to the Constitution.

eng_dev_5432	I recall hanging around in front of bars, asking adults to purchase beer for me and hoping they didn't walk away with my money. Those who contributed to my delinquency didn't make much if any money from the transaction. The beer they gave me was taxed, regulated, labelled and quality controlled. Whereas if I wanted cannabis, I could pick up the phone and have it delivered in an unmarked sandwich baggie. Decades later, teens still report that cannabis is easier to obtain than alcohol.   Here's the thing, when teens want to alter their state of consciousness, and they can't get weed, they attempt to get alcohol, or pills, solvents or something else. Cannabis is an economic substitute for alcohol and other drugs such an fentanyl. When cannabis use goes up, drinking and other drug use goes down, along with drug-related health and social costs such as accidents, overdose deaths, crime, unplanned pregnancies, violence, addiction, etc.	0	0

eng_dev_5451	Strange days.  Growth and rising employment with no inflation, and that growth fairly tepid when considering that it is tied to years of monetary stimulus.  I am guessing that a lot of this has to do with the wage gap.  The wealthy got that way mostly through the FIRE sector, which, while lucrative, creates nothing in the way of intrinsic value.  The 1% is also notorious for parking money offshore or sheltering it from tax in other creative ways.  What's more, FIRE does little to improve the lot of most Canadians since does little in terms of economic spinoff compared to manufacturing or other sectors.  If we want to climb out of this morass, we need to figure out a way to put more cash in the hands of the working class.  The economic booms of the postwar era were fuelled by wage gains and substantial gains in disposable income for the average joe.  Now we are seeing job losses through automation and the gig economy.  Share the wealth, or the economy will continue to stall.	0	0

eng_dev_5483	A billion dollars is one thousand million dollars and  now  we need billions to fund state government.  Each $1,000 of PFD payment requires an appropriation of approximately $700 million. Obviously Alaskans do not want a reduction in state funded services.    When the CBR (Constitutional Budget Reserve) is gone (perhaps as soon as next fiscal year)  the Earnings Reserve of the Permanent Fund will have to be used to  fund state government.  As stated, Alaskans do not want to give up state services; therefore our legislators cannot/will not reduce spending to compensate for the loss of the CBR.  After the CBR is gone if we still want  a PFD Alaskans will have to  place a $700 million dollar tax burden on themselves or others to pay each $1,000 dollars of PFD disbursement.     This fiscal dilemma was brought to you by at least two of the same legislators who are now running for Governor.

For most families that don't get a total or excess rebate, the effects will be little more than a dinner out a year, or a couple of tank-fulls of diesel in their rig-rockets. Nothing the better part of a day's pay won't remedy in a hurry.  I like our new government's approach, and the fact that they are not about to start panicking as soon as a few players start shuffling off to the exits. They can go and sulk, but they'll be back soon enough.	0	0
eng_dev_5503	WRONG! The the difference is between direct democracy as practiced in ancient Greece and representative democracy as practiced just about everywhere.   A direct democracy means EVERYONE decides the issues of the day. The only time we have direct democracy is when we vote on a ballot initiative. Otherwise, we elect representatives to the US congress, the Alaska legislature or to a local government body like the Anchorage assembly to pass laws on our behalf.	0	0

eng_dev_5572	I feel bad for the plight of Rosa Maria. And I understand the actions of her parents in bringing her to the US for the medical care since there are no medical care options in Mexico if you are poor. However, Rosa Maria's care is being paid for by Medicaid which is supported by state and federal dollars. In other words, the taxpayers are footing the bill for $100,000+ worth of care for someone who isn't supposed to be here. The reason why we have immigration laws is to protect the resources of our country (water, jobs, indigent healthcare, etc.) that are reserved for the citizens and legal residents. There are perhaps millions of Rosa Marias in the world in need of care. We will go bankrupt trying to care for them all.  At the very least Rosa Maria's parents should be charged with theft of services.	0	0

Pension plans can run as much as 9 or 10 dollars per hour per worker.   On top of that there are piles of other add ons that basically double the cost of an employee. If a worker wants to be paid out for his pension at some point, he will receive only pennies on the dollar.  The union keeps it all. For example construction unions.  The man might make 35 dollars per hour, but his rate ends up being 72 per hour .  This is where the unions make their massive monies.	0	0

They are also in contravention of international law by not applying for refugee status in the first country they escaped to, namely the USA.  Now they are seeking refuge ""from"" the USA? The only thing that is drawing them here is the fear  of deportation because they have overstayed their US visa.  Clearly there is the expectation that they will be fed, housed, schooled and provided health care for at Canadian tax payers' expense for many years to come as well.

eng_dev_5633	Rent or Own?  Note to individuals under 40...it is far cheaper in the long run to own and not rent. If you are able it's all about planning and focus. Long story short,  bought first home at 32 with small loan 10k  plus mortgage in 1973. Kept home, paid loan off early, sold it after 20 years and built new home. Sale plus savings allowed for new construction and no mortgage. Average cost per month to own my home, taxes plus home insurance 6,400,  utilities about 2,000 or $700 per month for 3 bedroom, 2.5 bath, 2500 square feet, 3 car garage. How much would it cost to rent a house with those spec's?...??, guessing about 1500 to 2,000 per month. So, planning plus not taking on unnecessary debt can result in the last 30 plus years of your life living way under the cost of renting - be it a house or most any apartment - tis really cheaper to own then rent and the bonus of discretionary funds for travel and toys.	0	0

eng_dev_5651	Any lower employment slows growth-- more people are unemployed and job growth is pushed downward-- unless tax benefits from the reduction benefit the middle class. Cuts in government employment did not spur more private job growth. Throughout Obama's term, the stock market boomed reflected in increased wealth for investors, but no investment in jobs and no increase in middle class consumption (but increase in consumer debt). Companies used profits (based in part on lower rates) and cash to buyback shares to increase share value but not producing new jobs. This happened during a period of large tax cuts started by Bush, continued by Congress and Obama, and added to by Obama. So government job cuts, lower taxes, lower interest rates, higher Stock market value, and huge tax cuts increased the deficit, but did not spur higher wages, and did not result in higher economic growth.	0	0

Fact: It is public land owned by the state, and while Native Hawaiians may have some allowances there, it does not give them the right to have an exclusive veto over the land for religious or other reasons.  That would violate the US Constitution by giving the a single group of people a religious claim over public land.

From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most gifts from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is always followed by dictatorship.  The average age of the world's greatest civilizations is about 200 years, and during those 200 years, these nations always progressed through the following sequence: from bondage to spiritual faith; ... to courage; ... to liberty;... to abundance; ...to complacency; ... to apathy; ... to dependence; ... back to bondage."" -Alexander Tyler, 1787."	0	0

Forced Unionism has become a major funding source for political activities in our USA, with most of it going toward progressive/socialist issues and/or candidates even though that is against the law.  While the upcoming Janus vs. AFSCME case will impact millions of public-sector workers, I sincerely hope our SCOTUS will address this major problem within the labor movement for all workers in America and our families.  Right-To-Work is 100% right for America, and that's probably why a reported 82% of Americans are opposed to Forced Unionism and support the concept of our RTW laws.	0	0

eng_dev_5783	Ok, Junior, let's look in the mirror and address your offensive deluded ignorance. My Chickasaw mother was born in 1936 in Snow, Oklahoma. This is the height of the dust bowl era in the middle of the dust bowl when all my sharecropper family had to eat was dust. In an act of desperation my grandma and her 12 kids thumbed a ride to Oregon coming here homeless and destitute to look for work in agriculture.   My family did not pitch a tent on public land demanding squatters rights, nor did they stand on street corners holding signs as professional beggars. My family pitched a tent in a cherry orchard and went to work.  In my case, I spent 2 years living on the streets during the great recession. As a matter of fact I came to Eugene in 1985 living on the streets destitute to look for work. though Eugene was running 11% unemployment rates I had no problem hustling up an entry level job, and supporting myself as is my obligation to do as an adult. <to be continued>	0	0

eng_dev_5801	My first comment was written in a rush and a bit glib. I've been following the auto industry over ten years professionally for two major blogs, and have followed Arcimoto since day one. Please note that I am very pro-EV.   In these years covering all sorts of start-ups (and failures) I have never seen anything like Arcimoto. They showed a prototype ten years ago and started taking deposits. There's absolutely no doubt that if it weren't for the name Frohnmayer and the private investor pockets that it's opened, this misadventure would have shut down years ago, as they have utterly failed in all this time to bring a viable product to market.   The EV market has profoundly matured since Arcimoto first showed its three-wheeler. One can buy very lightly used Nissan Leafs and other proper EVs for the $11,000 he's asking for his trike that has no real safety equipment, is not weather-proof, and is not really free-way compatible.   There are already  EV bikes and trikes already on the market.	0	0

eng_dev_5815	1. With regards to debt, selling off money making assets makes no sense.  Deficits can be addressed through other measures, including controlling spending, identifying efficiencies in government operations and cutting down on tax leakage.    2. As for the idea that revenue can be recaptured as corporate taxes.  The question is how much taxes can be recaptured?  Assuming your figure of $100M/yr in revenue, how much of that will be net profit which will be taxable when run by a private corporation?  Are we going to be faced with government bailout for failed corporations running essential public services?  3. I'm not sure how relevant global competition is for an asset like an airport, which services a fixed geographic location.  What has been evident is when corporations take over government assets, prices inevitably go up while services and jobs get cut back.  Something to do with the inherent profit motive demanded by shareholders of corporations?	0	0
eng_dev_5816	There are many parents and guardians struggling with teens and inappropriate conduct.

Not uncommon for teens to be running away from an unhealthy home life and unintentionally finding themselves in risky situations instead of rescue, getting caught up in bad stuff without meaning to. There are few resources. Where does one go? What does one do? What's the safety net? For a parent AND a teen. Particularly with 15-17 yo teens -- not old enough to access services independently (like Covenant House) but not young enough to be a priority for law enforcement and Child Protective Services.  Family counseling costs money and there are a ton of barriers. Even when parents try, you can't make a teen go. What do we do? How do we address this?	0	0

So it does not seem they are even following their own promise of some restraint in spending.  And I can't see any 2008 style recession that might justify some temporary public spending to compensate for a weak private sector. But this is the long-term problem with Liberal/NDP governments, and some Tories who are conservative in name only.  Keynes' countercyclical spending policy is a fine idea, IF you run surpluses in the good times, leaving fiscal room to spend during recessions.  But we never do the saving!  Chretien did better by far than Trudeau senior, but even he didn't pay off much absolute $ debt - he just held it such that debt/GDP fell slowly.  Harper was similar, but added the dumb GST cut (politics trumping good economics).

eng_dev_5876	West Good point.  However I do not regard daycare as a benefit to the child. If a family is poor certainly they should receive help, in money (Guaranteed Annual Income) not in child care subsidy. The family can decide how to use the money.  Important too is the effect on people in the work force if more join it. More competition for jobs, more unemployment, lower salaries. More unemployment means a further load on taxpayers. Lower salaries, more poor.  So money so that the poor can stay home to look after their kids would be a better solution. That is an investment in children. And easier on the taxpayer.	0	0

eng_dev_5899	Jerry: Thank you for your thoughtful comment. I'm not anti-development, however the history of these operations world-wide has not been good for anybody but the companies.   I believe development done right can be beneficial. What is important is local control of these projects because the people of the region will live not only with the short-term jobs, but the long-term effects of the operation. I, for one, like your input and the concern of others. It is my guess that this project will proceed: for the sake of the region, it needs to be thought out and done properly.  Having read many of the comments here, I would ask urban residents to consider that there are other values besides money.

eng_dev_6005	A bit of common sense , awareness of lobbyist-generated Congressional constraints, and recent health care trend history can tell us a lot.  Perhaps most importantly, initial obamacare use data tells us, in economic terms,  that providing insurance for the formerly uninsurable is meeting  a long pent-up demand for lower income Alaskans for non-emergency room treatment and prevention.  An initial period of high obamacare insurance use for a formerly unaddressed health care need is a to-be-expected impact. This has been true in all States - -as are the always-anticipated increases in  premium costs that follow the initial insurance use impacts.   Once long-neglected individual health care problems have been medically addressed, the initial surge of treatment care will stabilize - as should the levels of rate increases.  Lobbyist success with Congress in preventing competitive bidding for prescriptions, and the blocking of single-payer efforts both add a lot to these  costs of care.	0	0

Now if only the dairy, poultry and egg cartels can be eliminated.

More transfers of consumer/taxpayer funds into private pockets this time by restrictive supply mechanisms. Do Americans have similar systems?

eng_dev_6114	It is unfortunate that we humans have trouble with balance.  Regenerating forest is difficult especially in the presence of foreign invasive vegetation like scotch broom and blackberry.  These plants can quickly outgrow seedling doug fir making it difficult for the young trees to grow or even survive.  This is especially true on land that has not been replanted for a long time and the invasive species have become established.  As the article said, on rough land with steep slopes it is very difficult to even access the land.  Ever try to get through a dense growth of blackberry?  In such cases, use of aerial herbicide spraying may be the only way to bring the land back into production that makes economic sense.  If it costs more to replant than can ever be realized by eventual harvest, it makes no economic sense to plant.  So just how bad are the health effects of the applied herbicides?

Oh, and a deficit that will have to be slain on the backs of the long suffering taxpayers.  If billions are to be spent, why not get BOLD about it? 4-lane the Trans Canada goat track from sea to sea?  Put in true high speed rail links between major cities in Ontario, in Alberta, in Quebec.

Nothing to sneeze at, but it's an incremental rather than an exponential improvement (as some are painting it).    Maybe they didn't run the tanks dry on the previous launch.  Or maybe they didn't fill them all the way, and then this time they did.  Maybe they changed the O:F ratio and are getting more oomph from their hypergolics (same stuff our Titans use).  Looking at the vid, at most they might've stretched their bird a bit to make room for bigger fuel tanks.  More fuel = more total impulse.

Most people with a bit of effort could substantially reduce or eliminate their bank fees without switching to a new bank.  One of the obvious solutions is the minimum balance.  We are constantly told that one should have an emergency fund - maintaining a minimum balance is an obvious way of working towards that goal.  Avoid high cost ATM transactions is the other solution.  That said as a shareholder and someone who doesn't pay fees I am happy that so many don't follow suit.	0	0

Plain and simple, but guns don't kill people, people kill people.  It's a fact.   Arguing this fact only proves it's true. Look at it this way: When a cop shoots a suspect, we blame: 1. The training of the officer. 2. Whether or not the officer was racist (if applicable). 3. The actions of the suspect.  When a criminal shoots another person, we  blame: 1. The gun.

eng_dev_6325	This is a very generous gift by the Knights. And the University of Oregon really needs it. I'm not sure what happened to the UO's 2-billion dollar fundraising drive (started two years ago), whether this is part of that or completely separate. I was beginning to worry that while the UO had ideas to improve its national academic and research standing and profile, it had no real resources to turn those ideas into action and results.  I also commend the Knights for doing what other billionaires have pledged to do (e.g., Gates, Buffet), which is to give away most of their fortune to charity and other causes. They have set a great civic example of what great wealth could do in the advancement of society . While money doesn't solve everything, and some of the problems at the UO are not about money, let's hope the generous act by the Knights will spur the needed institutional reforms to maximize the impact of this gift and set the UO on a path to making significant contributions to science.	0	0

Trudeau's only accomplishments to date, like sort of getting along with Trump and a relatively robust but still fragile economy, have been achieved by default. But big minefields exist for the Libs on immigration, NAFTA and aboriginal affairs. On the latter issue, I suspect most Canadians have little interest in the models of aboriginal sovereignty proposed by many First Nations advocates. It will be almost impossible for Trudeau to achieve his vaunted new relationship with First Nations and keep the remaining 96% of Canadians mollified. And his broader predilection for identity pandering increasingly irritates many Canadians. The risks ahead are all Trudeau's to face.	0	0

eng_dev_6344	Everything about the Trump Presidency is laid back blase BS. There is one of 3 possibilities I personally see by playing the Presidency fast and loose like this:  1. Something will bite trump in the ass that will highly embarrass him, and he will sober up to the fact that he needs to take this job serious. (That is the best case scenario.)   2. Something will bite Trump in the ass and result in something hurting the US on an international level, and result in fallout on the international level. Take your pick what this is? NK invading SK for some reason. Trump pulling out of NATO resulting in Russia invading someone somewhere due to the chaos that ensues, etc.  3. Something that trump does in the US will cause a cascade effect at home. I can't claim to know what that would be, because its far too early in his presidency. Economy, race relations, etc. Its too soon to feel the fallout of climate change. Who knows.  But I can guarantee you one of those things is going to happen.	1	0

Imagine getting your kid to hockey practice at 5am by taking public transit.  Send your kids outside to play amongst the needles and the garbage?  Not likely.    There is a reason that the suburban lifestyle is so immensely popular with families, despite the enviro-nuts and city planners telling us we can't have what we want.  It is great for raising kids and it is a nice lifestyle for adults.  I'd rather mow a lawn than lug groceries up an elevator and along a hallway.  That's why 3 bedroom condos aren't common.

You don't need alternative routes that all go in the same direction, it just moves the bottleneck down the road, or roads that cost a fortune to go over or through a mountain.  The Kaena Point route would provide a pressure release valve for all those traffic jams on the Waianae coast, instead of stewing in traffic for hours or giving up and going home, you would have the option of going the long way around in the opposite direction, which is better than going nowhere.	0	0

eng_dev_6457	It is very sad but these events are not really rare.  black bears are more prone to predatory attacks on humans not just in Alaska but in Canada also etc.  They have a more predatory instinct, I have lived among brown bears a long time here in Alaska and never witnessed what I have seen in blacks.  They are distinctly different.  A brown will attack and maul out of defense.  A black will attack, kill and eat you just because it wants too.  Every bear cannot be predicted in behavior and you can't exactly catagorize them all the same either, they all have different personalities the same as humans.  Killing four just to get one was a little much but I guess considering the terrain they felt they had no choice but I can also imagine how stupid they felt each time they realized they had the wrong one.	1	1

The city had to finance and build a coffee shop in the Oval - they couldn't even find an operator willing to invest.  A large planned  riverfront restaurant never materialized.  Thousands of people are supposed to be living in the area and the streetscape is empty and dismal.

eng_dev_6507	Excellent letter Mr. Parker. Mr. Wohlforth is trying to get at the cause of extremely high medical cost/health insurance costs in Alaska but your letter  puts the finger on the button. Indeed if medical costs had not risen 91% over the past years then as you say insurance premiums would not have done so on a parallel track. It is obscene to think that medical costs are so inflated up here that people can fly to Seattle($600+or-), stay in a hotel($500+or-) and still save money on a routine procedure like a colonoscopy. This grossly inflated medical cost thing began when Reagan deregulated the medical industry and those not for profit General Hospitals became Corporate owned for profit HMOs. Medical care should not be a for profit industry but that is what it has become and it is why medical costs are inflated tens or hundreds of times more than general inflation levels. The markets cannot/will not regulate themselves as we saw with the financial industry as well as the medical industry.	0	0

They will probably do a phased withdrawal over the next few years.  Symantec will probably be completely gone by 2020.  Symantec has essentially been taken over by private equity groups, who could care less about Lane County.  The current President and Chief Operating Officer is Ajei S.

Although my friend had a legal registered weapon in his vehicle, as many who travel the roadways here do, didn't approach with a gun before or after asking the trooper if he needed a hand.

eng_dev_6579	Russell, Rover's Run has had three maulings that I know of, all involving brown bears. Two of the victims were bikers, one was running. No hikers have been injured on that trail. Rover's Run is closer to the creek than the two advanced downhill singletrack trails proposed in the park. But they aren't that much farther away, and the bears are relatively concentrated in the Spencer's Loop area by greater human activity in adjacent areas. Far North Bicentennial Park (with 4 maulings) and trails leading into it from nearby Chugach State Park (with 1 mauling) have more bear maulings than any comparable-sized area in Anchorage. At what point do we get to express our concern?  I wasn't comparing FNBP to Banff. I used the Banff study as the only example I knew where numbers of hikers and bikers were more or less known and a judgement could be made as to which user group had more bear encounters.	0	0

While I would rather see taxes on the externals of products, or a ""Natural Capitalism"" system as Amory Lovins and Paul Hawkins describe in the book of that title, I'm all for this tax because the wealthiest businesses can't wiggle out through some back door tax loophole or other maneuver.

eng_dev_6613	"Demento, I was referring to the status-quo in terms of political and diplomatic relations. The status quo is the armistice under which the peace has been maintained since the 1950's. Yes, the N. Korean nuclear arsenal is growing, but the US missile defense shield is growing too, globally mind you, as development has been paused in S. Korea under the new President. Where I have served in the Canadian Forces, I find your claim that I promote appeasement quite insulting, but your analogy, again, is flawed. See, when Chamberlain called for ""peace in our time"" it was after Germany had already invaded and annexed part of the former Czechoslovakia. Where N. Korea has annexed no new territory since the armistice, my support for the maintenance of the status quo is not appeasement, it is due to my value of human life and desire to preserve peace wherever possible. Your desire for a pre-preemptive strike, on the other hand, is analogous to the Japanese decision to attack Pearl Harbor in 1947."	0	0

The first incompatibility is inherent to brokerage roles and is a subject given a lot of study in economic theory. The question boils down to this: how cheap can the media be in getting public attention and still provide the quantity and quality of attention the advertisers want. Note that the 'customers' are the advertisers, with their money dwarfing any subscription payments from the audience by a very large factor. That makes us, the readers/viewers, the 'product'.

People who consume more health care should not be surprised that they pay more than people who consume less.  It is not necessarily unreasonable that rich people will get tax cuts and lower-middle-class people will lose tax credits either. This simply reverses the changes that Obamacare did. Obamacare imposed taxes on rich people to pay for subsidies for lower-middle-income people.  Of the people who will ""lose"" health insurance, many will be younger people who simply don't want to pay for it; if they get sick, they will get it then, because pre-existing conditions still will not be disqualifying. This is not a very intelligent way to use health insurance. But using tax policy to force people to make wise choices is an exercise in futility."	0	0

eng_dev_6684	@PokeStop:  Yup!  They definitely should have started from UH or Waikiki and if they ran out of money at around the Airport, at least it would have run from UH or Waikiki to the Airport and started generating significant amounts of revenue instead of starting in the middle of nowhere (Giant field where the Ho'opili Development is supposed to be built) and possibly ending in the middle of nowhere (Middle Street).  The fact that it only runs to Ala Moana Center makes me suspect that the rail ridership numbers are significantly inflated because you are excluding two other large groups of people (in this case the tourists that want to catch rail to Waikiki or students that would catch rail to UH).  Again, as PokeStop said, poor oversight and planning from the start and it continues to this very day.	0	0

Our government federally and provincially across Canada works exactly like this. The more money in the more money spent. It is always, and will always be spent with little oversight, common sense, little efficiency. That’s it. You see provinces with hst taxing more that have massive debts. Obviously more money didn’t make them better money managers, quite the opposite actually. They post phony  surpluses but debts are ever increasing. The problem is the way money is spent. That’s it. Bloated public sectors that’s sole obligation is to become more bloated. What bloats more then more money. Don’t be naive to think less equalization would magically turn these inept politicians to manage money any better. That includes cons, libs, and dippers.

Vancouver Sun: ""The B.C. government will likely have to hire hundreds of teachers and spend between $250 million and $300 million more each year on education, after the dramatic win by B.C. teachers [re: class size] in the Supreme Court of Canada on Thursday.""   What happened: not enough, obviously. Or ...maybe not.  Other stories followed. Van Sun: Aug 25: ""As of this week, 171 full-time jobs still need to be filled by September in Vancouver, Surrey, Abbotsford, Osoyoos, Fort St. John, Prince George and other districts, according to ...the recruitment arm of the B.C. Public School Employers Association.""  Really?  Just 171?? No problem! Yet, the scare headline is:""B.C. school districts in hiring crunch, face teachers shortage""  Now we learn thousands were hired and ""90% of postings are filled.""

Imagine if California's 55 EC votes, currently written off as ""Blue,"" went 33-22 instead, AK's little 3 votes, and the votes in other small states, would start looking far more necessary to get to 270.  Can't agree on tossing the EC entirely though. Look at the actual numbers, in essence the country would be led by people selected by a few, physically isolated and concentrated, mega-cities for Presidential elections and by the largest city(s) in any given state election of representatives to Congress.

eng_dev_6899	When the United States Congress enacted the federal Controlled Substances Act, it included  provisions explicitly authorizing states to enact their own laws.  Federal preemption applies where Congress either explicitly prevents states from acting or where Congress creates a comprehensive system which allows no room for state regulation.  Because Congress explicitly allowed state action under the CSA, Colorado's drug laws are not preempted by federal law.  There is no corresponding provision in federal immigration law, therefore states cannot enact their own laws.	0	0

eng_dev_6924	[Officials in the Trump administration on Sunday demanded Russia stop supporting the Syrian government or face a further deterioration in its relations with the United States.] Russia annexed Crimea and the relationship deteriorated (not to mention various sanctions and other diplomatic repercussions).  Russia pretty much went all in on Syria when it started sending air craft and troops to support Assad.  This is long after Russia disregarded international agreements not to provide arms to Assad.  Every time a anything that would impact on Syria negatively came up on the UN Security Council Russia vetoed it. So what exactly is the point of this proclamation?  It doesn't even amount to saber rattling.	0	0

I was totally in Rays' corner when we were fighting to repeal SB21 but now it is a different day and Margaret Stock is without a doubt the most qualified candidate to replace Murkowski and end the gridlock in the Senate. We need someone whose loyalties are to the state and not to a basket of corporate campaign contributors. One of Stock's foremost campaign goals is to end Citizens United as an effort to get some of the Billions of Dollars out of our election. Coming into office grossly indebted to those who bought you the office as Lisa Murkowski has and is doing is no way to remain loyal to the constituents who voted for you. Margaret Stock will enter the Senate as an Independent totally financed by small contributors. What a great concept ey? This is a chance for Independent Alaskans."	0	0

Still, I liked Whiz Bang so much that it got its own review two weeks ago.  You say you want excitement. I feel like that ground is well-covered by this city's PR-driven food media. Everyone at Portland Monthly, Sam Bakall at the Oregonian and Mattie over at Eater write breathlessly about every notable new opening using the Buzzfeed ""no haters"" ethos. It's all ""OMG BEST EVAR,"" and it's not especially sincere. Talk to writers and industry people off the record, and they're mostly with me.  There are exciting new food things in Portland, and I love covering them. But we're in an era where every one of those is matched by two things that are hype and marketing. I feel like someone has to call that out and no other publication is going to do it. I think you can see from other comments that some people want and need that.

Salaries and benefits for government workers should match those obtainable in the private sector. Given that America is now nearly 20 trillion dollars in debt, given the failure of so many government agencies to perform with accountability and efficiency (the VA comes right to mind), I do not believe that the leviathan which now exists serves the people well. btw, as anyone who has lived in any American inner city will assure you, the greatest health problem facing America's poor, is obesity.

eng_dev_7047	"Trump arrives in Israel, and asserts to the Israelis that ""We just got back from the Mideast."" (Where in the world does he think Israel is?) Trump vehemently denies doing something that no-one had accused him of doing: using the word ""Israel"" when he was disclosing classified information to the Russians. In doing so, he inadvertently confirmed what had heretofore only been speculation -- that Israel was the source of the classified information he had disclosed. Trump is an idiot, but he's Netanyahu's idiot. Netanyahu looked like the proverbial deer in headlights as he stood impotently listening to Trump make a fool of himself on the issue of classified information. Netanyahu threw his lot in with Trump, and he's stuck with him, at least for now. We all pray for peace in that very troubled region, and we will thank God if somehow Netanyahu and Trump stumble into it; but it's very hard to be optimistic. Trump doesn't even know where Israel is and undoubtedly could not find it on a map."	1	1

eng_dev_7049	I wondered exactly how much United Airlines can actually be responsible for? They did have the right to remove Dr. Dao but they were not responsible on how Dr. Dao was removed. That falls on the airport police who do NOT answer to United Airlines. (Many apparently believes they do.) Once law enforcement arrived at the scene, everyone else become a secondary status as it is in any situation of this nature. Obviously, United wanted that passenger removed but airport police were the ones that determined how that passenger was to be remove. People and city of Chicago will probably end up footing for all the compensations once the emotional and outrage feeling toward United are removed from the equation. Airport police were pretty stupid in the way they handled this entire affair. An more intelligent approach would have save everyone a lot of headaches but that is what you got when everyone involved, got the case of the stupid!!!	1	0

eng_dev_7088	I agree that culture has a lot to do with failure or success of education.  Parental attitude, passed on to children, is key.  Too many families don't make education of their children a top priority.  It's very easy to blame teachers, and complain about 'too much homework', and allow the child to get by with mediocre effort.  I believe schools could do a better job of using money available; there is a lot of waste.  I really don't know how we can blame one political party or the other, but defunding education altogether, as the GOP advocates, is not the answer.  The issue is that education is a two-way process.  A teacher teaches; a student learns, if he/she is receptive.	0	0

eng_dev_7137	At a 2016 seminar human settlements officials defended the housing policy: Mandela's government had 'no choice' about providing free houses. Despite its faults, it was policy. But nowhere else in the developing world do states have such an extensive role in housing as SA. They've tried to promote 'Breaking New Ground', but persist w/ the defective model of one family, one dwelling a plot. It's unsustainable, hugely costly and unfair, the last bec not everyone who needs a house will get one. The 'waiting list' is a joke, national database non-existent and people who already have houses or earn above the minimum income get one. Like so many of government's bright ideas.  The Grootboom decision was well-intentioned but impractical. State housing ought to be for the truly vulnerable - the elderly, infirm, etc, NOT people who can build their own, even in an informal settlement.

All the projects we are subsidizing to the tune of $700 million this year will never pay back that investment because of that clause written into SB21. Even the thirty year old Pt. Thompson field will be deemed ""new oil"" so that the industry will reap more while the state takes in far less badly needed revenue.

eng_dev_7172	"""I have been a Denver Post subscriber for 27 years, but your clear non-journalistic allegiance to everything anti-Trump has become unbearable for your objective readers."" -- James Holloway  ""Objective reader"" -- meaning, anything Holloway disagrees with is objectionable. I saw this phenomenon with Mike Rosen and Mike Littwin columns. I see this with Jon Caldara columns: People who are shocked that there's opinion in an opinion column. People who are shocked that someone writes an opinion they disagree with. I didn't like Rosen's columns, but that's because, by the end, Rosen was recycling opinions he already stated. I usually strongly disagree with Jon Caldara columns, but I'm not going to castigate him merely because he has an opinion. The guest commentary by César Cuauhtémoc is clearly labeled as a guest commentary. That means 1) it's his opinion, and 2) it's written by someone outside the Denver Post staff.

Most Adventists throughout our history have not been bent on purifying the church - although the very vocal minority made it look that way.  The same is true of how we were taught.  More often than not, those who had that bent were from three backgrounds:  1.  Those who came from a very ""worldly"" point and swung to the opposite part of the pendlum and wanted to do all that they could to live a changed life that would glorify God.  2.  Some who, when we graduated from the Seminary, wanted to go all out to be the very best clergy we could possibly be and who acquainted that with the  very rigid perspective of M.L. Andreasen and his spiritual progeny in the church.  3.  Many of the rest of us were damaged people who entered the ministry to try to find some kind of healing.  Research and experience have both shown that damaged people are very focused on control - to save themselves from being hurt in the future."	0	0

eng_dev_7305	Here is a idea.  Cut all State Government spending unto a level of say, $40 bbl which is realistic, and trim the State government so as to reflect said amount, cut all tax relief unto the oil companies that is based upon exploration, and apply it unto production., so that it benefits both the State, AND the oil producers as to the more that is produced, the more is benefited not only unto the companies that produce said product, but unto the State coffers as well, as well as the Fund itself.  Expand exploration allowances not within tax breaks for the exploration so as to produce said product, but within the production of said product itself.  Establish a static, and long forward thinking, contractual agreement with the producers so that they know what to expect within the production of said product, which is, upon both sides, fiscal stability.  They know what they shall get, based upon production, and the State knows what it shall receive, based upon that same production.	0	0

He notes with dismay the destruction of such as park wolves, baited out of the park to be legally destroyed by trappers and hunters. Marshall urges the governor and other relevant parties to negotiate a restoration of an earlier no-kill buffer that had been enacted by a wiser Alaska Board of Game early 2000, removed by an unwise game board intent on waging a turf war with Denali park. Completely ignored is the welfare of these million dollar animals that hundreds of thousands of  paying visitors seek with their  choice to visit Denali but fail to see.  It is incomprehensible that Alaskans sit idly by while the Alaska Board of Game utterly trashes a main Denali attraction while Gov. Walker, ignoring this debacle,  rings his hands wondering where are sustainable economic alternatives for Alaska? Restore the no kill buffer!	0	0

eng_dev_7335	I agree with Matthew Rainwater. Van De Wege underwhelmed, versus Danille Turissini, who was very capable, energetic and enthusiastic. At one-point Van De Wege said “legislators streamlined government and dramatically cut state services during the recession…”.  News Flash: The recession officially ended over 7 years ago in June of 2009. Missing since the recession is a recovery in the private sector of the economy, especially in Clallam County. In ten years of Democrat control WA State spending grew over 50%, from $53 Billion in 2003/2005 to $80 Billion in 2013/2015. Over the same period WA State Gross Domestic Product only grew 22% and WA State Real Household Income declined by 4%.  State government grew more than twice the rate of the growth of the private sector while wages were stagnant or declined.  Voters must ask themselves if WA State government growth is advisable or sustainable.	0	0

Walmarts are known to provide overnight parking for RV's & semi drivers needing a safe spot to pull off the road for awhile without hassle or danger.   Most people understand that by providing this service, Walmart is helping mostly honest people to not endanger the highways with tired driving, & a few criminals will take advantage of it, as they do any good deed.   That the papers aren't filled with nefarious doings by overnight Walmart parkers is proof this tragedy is not a Walmart thing, it's a criminal thing. Being at Walmart saved lives in this situation.

S Corps are not taxed.  Most states tax at least some types of business income derived from the state. As a rule, the details of how income from a specific business is taxed depend in part on the business’s legal form. More particularly, in most states corporations are subject to a corporate income tax, while income from “pass-through entities” such as S corporations, limited liability companies (LLCs), partnerships, and sole proprietorships is subject to a state’s tax on personal income.

A reporter later jokingly referred to this before launching into a more serious question; Trudeau seized on the opportunity.   “It doesn’t bode well for public trust in the media to be so easily fooled by government attempts at manipulation … It is our responsibility to decipher between PR and news, and a picture from the prime minister’s personal photographer is not a coincidence, and not news.

Uh, Donald, he gassed people in a huge attack when Obama was president; at the time, Trump several times said NOT to attack Assad over it. Yes, he said that! Now he says Obama should have. Bait and switch works for selling college promises, not so well in the political arena. Geesh. Health care try still in freefall. Seven years to get it planned; now, both houses and a president cannot get it right and blame Obama? This is getting childish: Mr. Trump, you now are President. Time to quit blaming the other guy: you have the power.  Gorsuch: if Trump would have put forward a moderate such as Garland, there would have been no problem. A radical such as Gorsuch?

eng_dev_7416	Manuel, I thoroughly agree with your post. I think that G&M should seriously start questioning the accuracy of what they are publishing about Catalonia, because it is SO heavily biased towards the separatists' camp. Nobody is speaking about the hatred that has been spread in Catalan schools against Spain for the last 40 years. Or through TV3. Or the harassment and public shaming that some Spanish children han to endure from their Catalan teachers in Catalan Schools after October 1st just because their moms or dads work as National Police or Guardia Civil Officers. Or how many families, coworkers and friends have split or turned into enemies because of the separatists intolerance. I see nothing published about the silent majority of non-separatist Catalans. The G&M only seems interested in the BS that the separatist Catalans put out. Why, if even for the sake of balance, don't they ask to non separatist Catalans and to people in other Spanish regions? I guess they don't want the truth.	0	0

It is unclear to me how anyone would offer Vancouver as somehow being a flagship of ""cultural blending"". Yes, there is a large group in Vancouver that embraces Feng Shui and speaks Mandarin and reveres family ancestors and likes brand new big houses and frequently has visits to, or has visits from, China - and there is a large group in Vancouver who trace family ownership of homes there to more than 50 years ago and have a variety of cultural habits that have nothing to do with the first group...  ... but I would not say that the two groups epitomize ""cultural blending"".

However the season unveils itself with the, defensive line --improved, tight end position --improved, offensive line --improved, running back position --improved and the return game --improved.  Hope fades... From there it starts to go downhill, the QB position isn't much improved and now Siemian may be hurt --disaster!  The no fly zone is reeling from the loss of TJ Ward. While Simmons is tall and a ""good prospect"" he is not a physical player in the tradition of a Broncos Safety. He also looks lost often. The coaching changes at the Head Coach position and the Defensive/Offensive Coordinator positions are not looking like an improvement.

eng_dev_7688	Not everyone tolerates ketogenic well, just as not everyone tolerates high-carbohydrate well. Epigenetics need time to adjust to produce the appropriate enzymes in sufficient quantity, which is why it takes a few weeks or even a year to adapt well to ketogenic, and vice versa to high carb. Further, there are genetic variants for critical enzymes (such as HMGCS2 in the synthesis of BHB) and some people cannot adapt well to relying on body fat for fuel--they would be first to go in a famine. The burgeoning diabesity epidemic indicates many people adapt poorly to the high-carb diet pushed by government since the late 1970s.  It's the epigenetic signalling effects and benefits for youthspan, cognitivespan, and lifespan that motivate many keto adherents. Aging researchers Newman and Verdin just published a helpful review paper on BHB as an epigenetic and metabolic signalling metabolite. Recent mouse studies showed dramatic improvements with keto diet, including a 13% increase in lifespan.	0	0

Trump does use a fairly common leadership strategy.   A good manager finds competent subordinates and takes their advice.  So far it appears he's unhappy with many of the early appointments.     But that's not what Trump supporters voted for.   What they are finding out is that President Trump is not so different.  D. Trump  said what he felt would get him elected.   It worked.  Most politicians have figured this out, both parties.   The election season is about winning, not policy.  We can evaluate President Trump by what he has accomplished while serving.  With both houses of Congress in Republican control and a friendly Supreme Court, he has an unprecedented opportunity to make his mark.   What do you consider his success so far?

If he is not being honest about the situation, he will only be dishonest again.  Figure it out for yourself.  Most people who have actually gotten away from a ""crazy"" ex do not encourage the crazies by keeping a facebook page or anything else showing a continuing relationship, especially if they have concerns.

The problem with this point is the writer intently bought their investment homes in ""residential-zoning"" and knew they needed to be rented as residences, not illegal  mini-hotels. If someone wants to operate a vacation rental, they should buy their investment home in resort zoning where these lodging businesses are allowed."	0	0

eng_dev_7871	The only potential downside to the rest of us is that the people getting into such deals are mostly on such shaky financial ground to begin with they are a high risk to default on their loan(s).  If enough of them default at the same time it could result in a bit of a flood of foreclosed homes on the market, rising the supply and reducing demand and therefore resulting in a price decline.  That being said, given that we're talking about a pretty tiny proportion of the total market it seems unlikely that the price decline from these loans, all on their own, would have much of an impact.  One of the biggest such lenders is noted as having TOTAL assets of $20B.  Even if these kinds of bundled mortgages was all they did (and it isn't, probably isn't even close to half) they would still only be representing only something like 0.2% of the mortgage market.	0	0

eng_dev_7910	Hi Bart,  I think you're right that a gas tax is a more elegant solution and probably more politically palatable.  The main goal is that economic costs of driving a private vehicle accurately reflect social and environmental costs to society, so people can make choices accordingly.  The only argument for a toll road or congestion pricing might be to relieve stress for certain overused routes or locations, or because there's a closer psychological link between the action, driving on H-2 during rush hour, and the cost.  I was thinking about reducing traffic rather than the environmental impacts.  They are overlapping but separate issues.  From a traffic reduction standpoint, a change that has a greater psychological impact is going to be the most effective, but also the most politically difficult, which is why reducing traffic is such an intractable problem. We all want other people to drive less. Viable alternative transportation options would help immensely.	0	0

eng_dev_7917	Easily found with a search of the internet, here are some excerpts:  In 2014, Wildlife Services, which operates under the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS),  killed more than 2.7 million animals, 1.3 million of which were native, noninvasive species. They included 570 black bears, 322 gray wolves, 61,702 coyotes, 2,930 foxes, and 305 mountain lions. In 2015 they killed 3.2 million animals, including 68,905 coyotes, 731 bobcats, 480 bears, 385 wolves, and 284 mountain lions.  Methods include but are not limited to traps, snares, poisons, gas, and aerial gunning (both from planes and helicopters).  Hate to tell you this Mike, but you don't know what you are talking about.  The Feds do use federal tax dollars for predator control.  And I don't see any reason that the State of Alaska can't allow the some of the same methods (aerial hunting) to achieve the same result but at less tax payer expense.	0	0

If the athletic dept operated like most, UO's tuition would be higher. Ticket prices are market driven and have little impact on operating budget. Season ticket prices are not increasing next year. Why? Because the team went 4-8 and there is less demand. Taggart offered Jaxson Kirkland, and tried to recruit Elijah Molden and Tui T., all in-state prospects who had committed elsewhere thanks to Helfrich.

One is free to infer anything one wants from a person's comments.  The danger is that the process of inference relies on the mindset and prejudices of the inferrer.  If a person is serious about determining fact and it is possible to seek direct and explicit information from a person in question, then to continue to rely on inference alone reveals something.  IMHO that something is that the inferrer is pleased with the inference and does not want to invalidate it.  Of course that is just my opinion.  Nevertheless, in my life, I always seek direct information, when available, rather than rely on inferences about other people's thinking.  If at some time, you wish to engage in civil, rational, to the point conversation, let me know.

From what little I have read about it appears to be an insulation material to be used along side tradition metal or wood framing (not like lego building blocks).   Industrial hemp would grow well in Hawaii but according to this website:  http://bringingithomemovie.com/hemp-house-top-10  2.5 acres (109,000 sf.) of land yields just enough hemp to be used in one 1,250 sf. house. Keep in mind that you would still need wood for the framing and roof. Also in order for the hemp to be made into the ""hempcrete"" lime binder is needed which can come from limestone deposits or coral.   I found this article here,  http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Feb/19/ln/ln22a.html  that talks about a lime stone deposit in Kauai.

Transport by other methods, for example rail, means that the risks are greater.  And if you're against the use of fossil fuels completely, then you are a hypocrite.  Fossil fuels are the reason we live such great, healthy and happy lives compared to others not so fortunate.

Reasonable minds can differ on the impact of Walker and his decisions. And ADN does not speak for a majority of Alaskans.  Glad no 'laws' were passed leading to the PFD raid. It might have been very difficult to have undone them. A little patience is in order. Walker's fear mongoring about what will happen to our PFD is over the top and not accurate. First he says we will lose it in two years. Now it is four years. Won't happen. There is nearly 55 B in the fund and around 11 B in the savings account. Let's see where crude prices go in the next year before we over react. They are moving up as we speak. Keep cutting expenditures. Streamline govt. If we need more revenues, start slowly instead of asking for taxes, our PFD, and hitting us with user fees all at the same time. As for Walker: it's four and out.	0	0
eng_dev_8000	Are you kidding me ?  There's no mystery here . The firefighters and other unions got Begich , er I mean Berkowitz elected . They know that the economy isn't so good at this moment so they are taking a freeze to help get Berkowitz re-elected so he'll be in a position to deliver a big raise the next time. They know Berkowitz is on thin ice with taxpayers so they don't want to give any conservative running against him--possibly Dan Sullivan , the ammo to win . IF this wasn't a cooked up deal to help Berkowitz  , Berkowitz would be boasting about holding the line and firefighters would be screaming like they did every time Sullivan moved his lips. You KNOW things are fishy when both don't want to talk about it.  The only other reason the fire union would go along with this is they possibly feel guilty for going over budget because their bosses let too many firemen off on vacation at the same time resulting in bogus overtime costs. Unions feel guilty bilking the taxpayers ? Probably never.	0	0

They would not even be a candidate for the food-bank.  Why oh why, did management not reduce the price to clear them out before they jumped the shark, and before they would have to be put in the compost.    At $2.69 each they were already vastly overpriced compared to local green grocers who were selling them for almost a dollar less.  This is where the waste, and the tragedy of food waste lies.

All other developed countries have adopted universal health care, and the U.S. should be advancing toward that goal instead of retreating from it.  The Republican idea of health care that Kozak describes is really an anti-health care idea.  As Roy Kamisato observes, the reduction in Medicaid funding would be used to create tax cuts for the rich.  Republicans are cleverly using ""health care"" to disguise enormous tax cuts for the richest 1%.  The 1% would be getting even richer, further widening the gap between them and the 99%.

eng_dev_8169	The current tax system is designed to reward capital over labor. The result is a steady increase in wealth gaps. Canada is not as tilted as the US in this regard and the US is about to get a lot worse, but as a person with a lot of discretion in how to structure my income and how to invest it I understand how the game is played. There are some who claim this is necessary to (i) reward risk taking or (ii) to adjust for other parts of the system that are poorly designed like ABIL (Allowable Business Investment Loss). As for (i), I would like to see actual evidence of this claim. For (ii) the solution to a bad design is not to layer on more poorly thought out provisions. Taxation needs a complete overhaul.

eng_dev_8205	I tend to agree with the parrot.  Regardless of whether the proposal is right or wrong, it simply isn't going to work for Canada.  This carbon tax proposal is going to increase costs for both business and citizens at a time when we urgently need to reduce costs to stay competitive.  If the federal government wanted to increase taxes, they should have simply increased income tax, or increased the GST, or even increased the excise tax on gasoline if they want to reduce consumption of gasoline.  But when you increase the cost for business to operate in Canada at a time when business is already exiting Canada, you make a fundamental mistake.  Income tax revenues are probably going to drop for both provincial and federal governments, while deficits spiral.  And it's highly likely the world is going into economic recession next year.  It's hard to imagine why a government would want to bring such hardship on its own citizens for the sake of superficial appearances.	0	0

They couldn't even hold his drug consumption against him, because he transparently and smartly admitted to smoking lots of pakalolo in his high school days.  H. Clinton made a few mistakes I'm sure she'd like to take back:  1) Using a private server out of laziness, no criminal intent.  GOP leaders dragged this on forever to fool those who cannot read.  2) Taking millions from Wall Street.  Again, nothing criminal and nothing Trump wouldn't do, but since she was running as ""the people's candidate,"" this left her open to criticism from the con artist himself.  3) Not being street wise and unable to talk back at the unconventional Trump.  Same as with the other GOP candidates, like deer staring at headlights when the Trumpster hurled insults at them.  I think Obama woulda put him in his place."	0	1

The Liberals prioritized Corporate interests, while it's common knowledge that small businesses are the real economic driver. 2. Governments are not the be all and end all of economic activity.  ""Liberal-generated surplus""?  Let's drop that illusion.   3. The Liberals prided themselves as ""the people in the business suits"", yet were way off in their forecast.  How does this qualify them as having been competent managers - especially as the pronounced miss was on the 'positive' side? 4. A surplus pales when racking up all-time-high debt, and seeing highest poverty levels in Canada.   Liberal pundits are guilty of 'heads I win, tails you lose' logic here.  If the economy 'grows', that's the former government's credit.  If it doesn't, that's the NDP's fault.  No matter WHAT the NDP now do, they will fail based on this logic.  Ridiculous."	1	0

Which story to pursue?   The saddest is that elderly pensioners have been lied about. Defenseless.   In 1980 there was an ad in the G&M saying ""YOU OWE $6 BILLION TO  THE SPECIAL FULLY INDEXED CIVIL SERVICE PENSION PLAN"".  True  Editorials followed saying how unfair it was - public servants had indexed pensions while the private sector could not afford indexing.   FALSE   The deficit of $6 billion was due to under funding. The actuarial report showed cost of indexing as 4.7% of salary. The gov't was depositing 2% of salary.

eng_dev_8399	An idiotic comment. We cannot boost any economy with waste and environmental destruction. BC Hydro's residential, commercial and industrial customers used less electricity in 2016 than in 2005, according to the utility's own records. BC can create yet more reductions in electricity consumption easily by investing in more efficient motors and lighting. In addition, solar power can be generated on utility scale at far less than what Site C will cost. Alberta created power capacity at Shepard Energy Centre at $1.75 million per MW. Site C will cost $8-10 million per MW. That means we won't be selling expensive power to our neighbours. Nor will we sell surpluses to California where they are closing power stations because conservation is happening through modern technologies.  If the only reason to build Site C is to create jobs, we'll create more jobs by building it with picks, shovels and hand labour. That would employ more people.	1	0

Despite a  ruinous National Energy Program under Pierre Trudeau and decades of hide-bound imposition by the  rest of Canada inhibiting  Alberta from accessing world oil markets offshore, the money flowed.  All that time Albertan chemical engineers wrestled the once speculative oil sands resource into a competitive, productive part of the petro economy.  Alberta has a very large, productive agriculture sector and productive forest industry. Calgary is a thriving corporate center and the province  has good universities and good hospitals. Aside from uniformly bad drivers, it has decent highways. All of this while the rest of Canada confiscated $billions, returned nothing and then inhibited Alberta's oil sector.	0	0

eng_dev_8466	GHG emissions did drop by about 30m tonnes in Ontario with the elimination of the coal plants but that was quickly overwhelmed by the demand from the large numbers of immigrants coming into the province.  Ontario electricity rates are about mid pack for the world.  Regions with a lot of water falling off rocks have lower rates (Manitoba, Quebec, Norway).  Regions which are lower on the coal replacement curve have lower costs but theirs will climb more rapidly as they go green.  China has about the same rates as Ontario and rates in Mexico are about 25% higher.  The job loss claim is utterly bogus.  Blame rigged exchange rates and globalization.  Energy is becoming increasingly scarce and therefore more expensive.   In 50 years most of our energy will be renewable ie less abundant, more expensive and more intermittent.

He said people were so desperate for employment that he would use any opportunity to assist them.

Maybe it might have been different if we'd been able to send out mercenaries in the Middle Ages who would bring home their wealth gained from death-dealing to fund a confidential banking system, but that didn't happen. We discovered mineral wealth instead.  The sale of Prudhoe Bay oil, which represents a tiny fraction of the known oil reserves in Alaska, benefited my family with jobs that didn't make us ""rich"", but certainly beat starving and made us a good deal more ""wealthy"" than my Alaska parents ever thought to be.

But, the ombudsman’s review of the Governor’s budget for Fiscal Year 2018 indicates that OCS did NOT request additional funding for front-line workers. OCS is currently funded for 476 front line workers and the agency has requested that same funding carry over to FY 2018. This leads the ombudsman to question the Department for not requesting additional staff in the Governor’s budget.  The Ombudsman's office has offered many findings of where the OCS has erred and caused damage to families and children due often to reasons that are management related, yet Ms. Lawton refuses to adopt needed change	0	0

eng_dev_8557	There seem to be a lot of Trumpsters in Alaska.  I can't understand why.  With the exception of a few nut cases gazing at Russia through their kitchen windows, most Alaskans seem pretty intelligent.   Perhaps their news is so filtered by passing through the great Canadian wilderness, that it is skewed.  However, the last time I was there, the internet seemed to work fine.  So, here goes.  Trump thinks you are idiots, and he can do or say anything, and you will still vote for him.	1	0

eng_dev_8562	No problem. I just led off with that so I wouldn't have to repeat it but I think I kinda did anyway. :)  That certainly wouldn't solve all the problems with huge costs and high pricing withing out health care system, although I do believe it would be a big help.  It would give consumers more choices and more options to fix what they want/need, and it would force providers to compete much more than they do now.  Maximizing choice and competition are the cornerstones of cost containment in any product or service.  Re: the auto insurance and homeowner insurance, both differ greatly from health insurance. The mandate for auto is only liability (you injuring someone else), not for yourself. If have a loan, your lender requires insurance on the car to protect their collateral, but that's not a govt mandate. Same with homeowner ins. That's mandated by the lender, not the govt. The govt doesn't mandate any auto or home insurance to cover yourself. Nor should they for health, IMO.  (cont.)	0	0

But going from 30th to 16th in goals-against (3:37 to 3.10) still means you’re bad defensively.""  I don't get this reasoning at all. Moving up ten spots offensively is ""impressive"" but moving up 14 spots defensively is ""still bad?"" By definition, in a 31-team league, being 16th is average, not ""bad."" And in shots allowed per game (which IMO is a better indicator of team defense than goals against) the Avs are 10th in the league, which is top third. It may not last but right now, the Avs D is not ""bad."" It's actually relatively decent.  And this is at least the second time I've read Chambers describe MacKinnon as a ""natural goal scorer,"" which I also don't get. A natural goal scorer should average more than a goal every four games.

eng_dev_8628	How many times have you seen the following:  One transport pulling out to pass another and taking the next 10 minutes and miles of highway to finally get past.   All this and 1/2 hour later the truck which passed is 15 - 30 seconds ahead of the slower truck.    It's just not worth it.  Trucks should be in a restricted lane, and passing should be prohibited, except in designated areas.  Concurrent with this should be driver education about lane discipline and yielding (instead of blocking) when a car comes up from behind.    It is not up to drivers to enforce the speed limit.    So if a car is tailgating - just move over and let him/her pass.    Don't be a stubborn jerk and block traffic, which should be ticketable offence.     That will help traffic flow, and if the tailgater is really speeding (or weaving in and out) leave it up to the police to catch them.	1	0

eng_dev_8632	You are right.   In many countries only tourists tip. In doing so, they upset the local economy and change it for everybody.   In such cases, on my own I tip the amount natives would tip.  The tour companies suggest tips because they want the guides and drivers to be happy to work with their company.  If their groups are known as poor tippers, the best ones will refuse to work for them.  I follow the tour companies guidelines but tip nothing if the service was poor and would tip over the top end of the range for extra service.  I have been know to increase my tip if I know that others (who can often easily afford it) are shorting on the tip.  Another thing, if the tour company takes care of tips, they pay it to the tour agency in country and the entire tip is not passed on to the guides and drivers.  Best to tip directly.  Also, I do not partake in group tipping, always give my tips separately in an envelope and discreetly thanking the person personally.	0	0

Our children walked past a cougar every morning walking to Franklin school. Bears came into our back yards after our unsecured trash. Never was there a human harmed. Animals have disappeared, so yes, keep your pets safe. I live out west now and can add a bunch of other WILD animals to this list, with NO harm done to any human. Teach yourself and your children to be aware and how to scare WILD animals away. Don't go into their dens, etc.	0	0

Do you think it is a good idea to have the government of a  communist country own health facilities in Canada? To eventually  own enough of them that they can control that sector of extended health care?  Do you think it is a wise idea to have another country control the entire supply chain of a large industry?

They obviously do not at this time use marijuana, and quite likely never did!  I cannot believe that our government is so naive to suggest that I will be able to grow 4 marijuana plants, but I will only be able to legally possess 30 grams at one time but I can grow for marijuana plants that can only produce up 30 grams of cured consumable is absolutely ridiculous.

eng_dev_8695	It has been my experience that people get some things right even though they sound a little goofy. I think supporting Trump is a bit like that. There are some things he says - just like Bernie says - that reflect how many folks feel about the politics of this country.  So the answer to your question is - no. Electro shock is simply too expensive on an individual basis - and the outcome is in question as well - ha!!  But when we tell folks that we don't know from Adam - whose political support we seriously disagree with - that they are stupid, misguided, or in need of electro shock - particularly if we are masquerading as some arbiter or truth and rational thought -(which Haycox always sees himself as) - then we stop being agents of change and start being agents of war.   To me Haycox is like Hannity - boys who bring matches to a flammable party. I think Trump is a nut job - but I still value my friendships with those who support him too much to call them stupid. That's my politics.	1	1

What's more they are almost all running deficits, which is akin to not even being able to afford the interest on their debt, let along paying down a dime of the principal.  Of course selling off your investments in order to go on a vacation in the Caribbean makes no sense at all, and that seems to be one of the suggestions being tossed around here (selling assets to pay for ""infrastructure"" projects)."	0	0

It was for disobeying court orders, several, to tell the truth at the Paula Jones Grand Jury. I would say that would constitute Perjury but he only got Contempt of Court. He did commit perjury and got away with a lesser offence. He was impeached, rightfully, for perjury and obstruction of justice due to lying to a Grand Jury.

You may have noted that Ruppel points out in her article that current Arctic seabed methane releases in many cases are coming from terrigenous permafrost that was drowned by rising sea levels after the Last Glacial Maximum.  My own views on your point are conditioned by field research on modern Alaskan permafrost terrane, viz., GSA Special Paper 319, Pewe et al. (1997), ""Eva Interglaciation Forest Bed - Unglaciated East Central Alaska:  Global Warming 125,000 Years Ago.""  In that paper, they document how Alaskan permafrost was totally melted up to the Brooks Range during the last interglacial, when it was at least 5 deg. C warmer all year round than it is now.  Not just for a little while, either.  Centuries at least, possibly a millennium or two.  But, the World Didn't End.  Does that change your perspective?  Something to think about.

Hillary certainly doesn't ""excite"" me  as a candidate, but I'm reminded of the old story about the two guys being chased by the bear.  One comments to the other ""I don't have to outrun the BEAR.""  Hillary, warts and all, is a far superior candidate to the Donald. My decision on voting is, as, in my opinion, it should be, based on a comparison of the two candidates on the ballot in November.    Trump is not only a mean-spirited, obnoxious person, he, additionally, hasn't clue one about the processes of governing or the issues involved.

McCain should have served time for his involvement. But the major damage that McCain has caused is the many years that he has worked against his own party involving legislation that the Republican Party supported.  The best example occurred recently when he last ran for his Senate seat.   He clearly stated to Arizona voters that if they would reelect him to the Senate that he would see that Obamacare was repealed in its entirety.  The videos are available on YouTube.

eng_dev_8873	The Health and Welfare department of the federal government completed a report “Charting Canada’s Future” which concluded that Immigration has only a short-term effect on Canada’s age structure. Moreover, increases in immigration to as high as 600,000 per year would have, in the long-term, no impact on the age structure. Even changing the age structure of immigrants from 23% below age 15 to 30% below 18 and then 50% below 15 would have little long-term impact on Canada’s overall age structure.

I once changed my tax guy from the mainland to Hawaii one year and the guy in Hawaii so messed up my taxes I had to pay over $12,000 when the year before I paid almost zero.  Had the same income, etc. I left that guy in a flash.  Had to refile and get the money back.  He worked for a big firm, had lots of experience, and knew nothing. Never again!!  He must have been working for Caldwell, etc and the train guys.  This is exactly what is happening here with this train.  I bet there is at least $5Billion in over charges and graft.  This story is going to have a huge negative affect on Hawaii as businesses think twice, as well as homeowners, as it is in the news every single day.

eng_dev_9003	The theory is that the incentive for the larger, more expensive houses will diminish with the subsidy that the mortgage interest deduction provides.  Another thing is the increase in the personal deduction will make it so fewer people on the lower end will be using the mortgage interest deduction and not have a financial incentive for larger, more expensive houses.   For more affordable housing Joe Carpenter brings up one way to help get more inventory, subsidizing or incentivizing  developers.  Another way is to let the market take care of the issue.  At some point (soon here in Denver) the demand for higher end homes will be satiated and developers will be pushed by the market to build lower cost dwellings since they won't be able to sell otherwise.  Zoning and building regulations can also be used to push for more affordable housing with things like forcing the builders to set aside a percentage of the units as affordable.  Welfare for developers should be the last resort.	0	0

To live by those beliefs is integrity.  To cast them aside to reach a desired goal is, in my opinion, hypocrisy.

The Chief Executive can submit what he wishes; in the end the Legislative Branch is in charge of the budget.  That is why no one is happy with the work product of the Alaska Legislature.  They diddled around with the guns on college campus drama and then diddled some more with restricting teenagers from having instruction on health.  The one thing they are supposed to do they didn't and you can't blame the Governor.  It's not his job  to pass the budget.  He can propose but that is all it is.	0	0

The true numbers driving housing are natural increase, plus immigration, plus foreign buyers and temporary residents which equals 600-700,000 per year (considering that there are about a million people here on ten year or student visas so 200,000 per year). Vancouver buying dropped by almost %50 with the foreign buyer tax so that is a reasonable estimate (that there are as many foreign buyers as domestic buyers in the market).

A real problem is that one does not see what one does not see, if you catch my drift.

eng_dev_9183	A final word, if you're worried about the next downturn you should be even more concerned about mutual funds than ETFs. People that hold mutual funds are primarily retail investors with limited knowledge of capital markets, i.e. they are more easily spooked and will sell on fear as opposed to a rational assessment of relevant factors including their own financial situation. That forces managers to fund redemptions by selling into a falling market causing it to fall even faster, it's a vicious circle. Managers may have to make snap decisions that are governed by liquidity over value and thus not in the best interests of other unitholders, especially if there are tax consequences involved. Speaking of taxes, a mutual fund is required to pass tax consequences on to its unitholders who may or may not have participated in the gains that triggered the taxes depending on when they bought the fund. Tax liabilities are just one more reason to avoid mutual funds in the first place.  /rant :)	0	0

eng_dev_9189	The idea behind Medicaid Accountable Care Organizations is that they are essentially capitated, with some adjustments.  Put another way, Centene/Trillium receives a set payment per insured, and has the responsibility for contracting for health care for them.  Ideally, this aligns the profit motive with wellness, as healthier folks cost less.  Of course, there are also incentive payments for meeting wellness metrics.  Keep in mind that Centene/Trillium could actually lose money as well, as they were apparently doing in Kentucky.  One presumes that the shareholders were paid because Centene believes that they can make money under this model.  If so, it will be because they're keeping people healthier.  Looking at it from another point of view, they're paying this money largely in the hope of FUTURE payments.  I certainly agree that it's on the state to make sure that these payments are reasonable.  So, 2 questions - will Centene provide good care; and will the state control costs?	0	0

I don't think many would disagree , but have you ever looked at the populations of these countries and asked why they cannot be producing the goods and services they do for their own people , not for export ? Why should Canada , or the U.S. , or any other country , open their markets to goods and services produced in these other countries ?   We all do not benefit from free trade . NAFTA has resulted in major job losses for a large number of Canadians .Balance trade with other nations is a very good idea . Free trade agreements , such as those agreements  are now worded is far from beneficial to Canada or the U.S. .

Increasing the capital gains inclusion rate would be a horrible deterrent to investment in the Canadian economy and would more than counter any benefit from the stimulus spending the government is attempting. Taxing the primary residence is not an answer either because that would harm the housing market as fewer people would be willing to sell and buy a new home since the tax would immediately eat into the money they would have after the sale to put towards a new home.

Texas increased its oil production by one million barrels of oil per day since Attorney Bill Walker became Governor because they elect their oil & gas commissioner and have a better system that prevents monopolies and provides reasonable permitting and bonding laws that allows competition.  Alaska is having trouble because the current system keeps oil & gas investors out of Alaska!

Approximately 1% of that country is fluoridated, with over 2,000,000 school kids participating in school-based fluoride mouth rinse programs.   . China is one of the most fluoride polluted areas in the world.  Chronic exposure to abnormally high levels of environmental fluoride pollution from coal burning factories and other sources is a huge problem in this country.  It obviously has no need to fluoridate its water. . Steven D. Slott, DDS	0	0

eng_dev_9281	For all of the small business owners, incorporated professionals, their spouses , family and friends out there who want to fight back against this latest Liberal tax grab there is a very effective way to do so.  Each individual donates a minimum of $100 to the Conservative Party.   Those monies can then be used to mount an intense media campaign across multiple platforms to counter the government propaganda and false information as to the effect that these very material changes will have on the Canadian economy.   In addition, the opposition parties should make the negative effect of these changes the main topic of Question Period. If enacted, the objective would be to profile the negative impact of the changes in the year leading up to the federal election.	0	0

eng_dev_9287	In addition to higher taxes, another element that no doubt helped Quebec reach surplus is that it pays public officials a reasonable wage, unlike the grossly inflated public sector salaries and benefits that are helping bankrupt Ontario.   Ontario has the most overpaid police officers, firefighters, teachers, doctors, and medical administration officials in the country, where making six figures is the norm, not the exception. Until this outrageous leeching off the taxpayer is addressed, and the public sector unions are confronted instead of bought off, the province's debt crisis will continue to spiral out of control.   You should be able to live comfortably performing a public sector job, not get filthy rich.	0	0

I also looked for a CDC connection between cats and rabies and couldn't find any. He mentions he is a biologist 'by training', which means not by practice. A google search turned up a blogpost mentioning 'a' degree in fisheries biology, so he probably has an unused BS degree. Hardly an expert to be listened to. Rick Sinnott, who is mentioned in this article, actually retired from a career as the state biologist. He seems like more of an expert to me.  I don't know why ADN continues to publish this.

We went to the Seattle area and got surgery and after had complications, all this medical caused us to be over the arbitrary 180 day absence and if we used the medical allowance it only allowed 45 days other absence, when we had vacationed 89 days in the spring, then told I had cancer September 1st, so we were denied and appealed and were denied in appeal in 2 of their 3 steps and are awaiting the decision in the 3rd step.  I am a 69 year resident, born and raised, and my wife is nearly 40 years here.

eng_dev_9436	If the government were truly concerned about fairness, they would amend the tax code to allow salaried employees to income split: as it stands now a single, high-earner household is unfairly penalized relative to a 2-earner household.  Further, the government does not have a revenue problem, it has a spending problem.  If we take their projections at face value - $3 Billion in additional taxes + $250 Million from eliminating 'sprinkling', it is barely 10% of the $30B deficits that they have created.  Trudeau/Morneau inherited a balanced budget and a growing economy.  That whirring sound is Keynes spinning in his grave at the wastefulness in what are (for the moment) good economic times.

So far, my decision seems to be the right one, as my private investments are doing way better than the funds I used to have:  1) Fidelity fund with a  2.23% MER is standing at 0.28% YTD; 2) another Fid fund, with a 1.97% MER, is at 0.08%; 3) a third Fid fund, with a 1.66% MER, is at -- gasp! -- minus 0.46%; and finally, a TD fund with a 2.03% MER, is at 0.66%. Yikes! In answer to your question... I had no risk tolerance when I finally understood that my advisor had invested 100% of my money in low-performing mutual funds. Now that I've diversified my investment to include a 2.4% RRIF term deposit, my risk tolerance has spiked and I am comfortable investing for the long term.

eng_dev_9473	Being at Columbia University in physics in the 70's, I have to take issue with Isenberg's history.  There was little doubt in physicist's minds in the 1970's about black holes.  Without even getting into general relativity, it was clear that a suitably massive star simply could not by any known force avoid collapse to a singularity when no longer able to generate fusion power.  Also, Newton was essentially silent on gravity waves dealing rather with relatively stationary bodies.  If Isenberg had asked Newton what would happen if the sun were displaced by million miles in 10 seconds, I suspect Newton would have paused and speculated on a gravitational field distortion at large distances from the Sun that resembles gravitational waves.  Of course, we cannot ask Newton, but the point is that the analogy between the emission of electromagnetic (light) and gravitational waves is not so incredibly different.  Discarding Isenberg's history, of course detection of gravity waves is important.	0	0

As a result of Tegan’s patently false statement I have received the absolutely predictable defamation insults from the public. I made manifestly clear to Tegan – both in the phone interview and in previous emails to her – that the ONLY reason I ran is to inform the ASD parent population of the 4 issues already (during my “candidacy”) well-disseminated in print and over the air. Because of the disgusting assault on our children by treasonously negligent administrators, school board members and politicians continuing now after 25 yrs.

My guy lost early. But for people like yourself to generalize about the failing of all democrats shows you have more an agenda of hate than cooperation. And it's no wonder. Just like the Democrats, the Republican party has seeded and nurtured hate to fill their coffers with donations.

eng_dev_9557	Yes you can say that about gasoline vehicles as they change every two years unlike baseload power plants that cost hundreds of millions and last for decades.  The urgency regarding AGW doesn't square with the dogma that the agonizely slow and extremely costly adaption of electric vehicles powered by intermittent renewables is the only politically acceptable means to combat AGW.  Hybrid vehicles and natural gas baseload electric generation have done more to reduce carbon emissions in the last decade than all other technologies combined.   Instead of attempting to eradicate natural gas production and ban the export of natural gas to coal dependent nations the Sierra Club and others would do better to encourage quicker adoption of proven and cost effective low carbon technologies.	0	0

eng_dev_9719	Trump is a strong supporter of single payer health plans and this is from Trump himself and not the Washington Post.  He has said this several times using Canada, Australia, and Germany as examples. Several people in his campaign, like his speech writer, and his Alt Right (far right conservatives) supporters joined him in supporting single payer. He made a statement for universal health care after the election-- health care for all regardless of whether they could afford it or not. As to the wall-- Congress will need to approve funding and it has not yet-- not the government of Mexico who has said it will not pay. Mexico and NAFTA have gained big time US political support from big Republican and conservative donors who do business with Mexico selling and buying-- they  strongly oppose the wall.

eng_dev_9758	The endorsement has a funny opening that says that Brown was thrown into the deep end when she took over as governor. It's funny because she took over only after having thrown the previous governor off a cliff. The left urban Democratic clique that managed that coup is still in power. But that misdeed and the misdeeds involved in cleaning up after the coup are now in the past. Politics is politics. For better or worse, we have to deal with the now.  Brown was a good secretary of state. She was not a good governor at the start. I have grudgingly watched her become better and better, and I have gradually come to see her strengths. She has learned from her experience. I don't think she will ever be a governor for all of Oregon. I think her sympathies are too limited and her base too restricted. But I believe that she is easily the best candidate and that she will be the more effective governor. I feel much the same about Rosenblum. I have to admit that the Oracle outcome was a good one.	0	0

eng_dev_9839	Actually, Paul Dart is a medical doctor who received his MD from Mayo Medical School. He later studied osteopathy to add to his expertise in medical practice. A doctor of osteopathy (DO) degree is another pathway to medical practice. DO's are fully licensed as physicians equal to MD's, with equal scope of practice--they fill the same positions as surgeons, psychiatrists, etc. They just happen to have additional training in manipulative medicine that is a source of envy for many MDs, which is why some MDs take advanced training in osteopathy. Dr. Dart is highly respected in Eugene and beyond for his advanced expertise in patient care. He led the consortium of health professionals who prepared the review of scientific literature that was presented to EWEB concerning smart meters, and which influenced EWEBs policy to have use of smart meters be opt-in.

eng_dev_9889	The liberal elite who are congratulating themselves at this moment might just ponder on the revolution that resulted in Brexit and Trump. We escaped at the last election because people thought that someone young, fresh and untainted by political duplicity might give us something different. The French recently tried the same thing. Perhaps they will have better luck than us. Human rights above all else will be the death of democracy. Small groups of determined individuals with agendas now run this country. This case succeeded because a lawyer with an obsession worked for free all the way to the Supreme court to prove that even a terrorist has rights. He succeeded, but at what cost? There are thousands of veterans out there addicted to drugs or disabled for life. Why is this convicted terrorist from a family of terrorists more deserving than they? The Charter of rights and freedoms has just kicked them all in the teeth. Justify it all you want, but it is wrong. Very wrong.	0	0

The biggest difference is having 2 parent households. Middle class tend to have both parents in their lives.   But we also don't usually end up in the ""upper middle class"" until becoming empty nesters and working our whole lives. Trying to say that we are somehow responsible for poor people is ludicrous.

eng_dev_9896	There are a couple of problems with Andrew Willis’s pension plan CEO friendly article:  1. First, while he has cause to note the risk that the Federal Government could abuse the infrastructure bank for partisan purposes, he neglects to note that the pension fund CEOs can (and will be sorely tempted to) abuse that bank for the profit of their own corporate advantages. In fact, the CEOs can almost with a straight face argue that doing so, provided it isn’t too egregious, is their duty to the corporations for which they are CEOs.  Governments are at least accountable to Parliament and the voters.  2. Second, Mr. Willis notes with favour the UK and Australian experience but doesn’t note as well the complaints over the years that the private sector governors of the infrastructure banks in both of these countries have abused these banks in the manner described in point 1 above.  If I'm wrong , I look forward to others making this clear with actual details and not mere ideological assetions.	0	0

In particular, project developers on the Ewa Plain use quick and dirty ""check box"" surveys for Pueo. The contracted ""bird specialist"" (who never have any expertise with raptor habitat) receive a check from the developer for a few hours on a site so that ""No Pueo Found"" can be included in their EA or EIS document.

eng_dev_9940	Licensing requirements have become largely a barrier to protect the jobs and income of license holders. Look at the construction business. A master plumber is equally qualified to put a new toilet in your house and do the pipe fitting for a nuclear power plant. Likewise a master electrician. Of course neither of them is likely to be doing any actual work on your house. The work will be performed by apprentices making $15/hour (though you will be billed $80/hour) working under the license holder. It has often been suggested that there should be residential licenses for construction trades with much less stringent requirements. Chances of getting that past the current license holders? Zero. The net effect - A few getting rich off the labor of others. And lots of people doing work without permits.  Now that most States and many cities have turned occupational licenses into a massive revenue stream the chances of reform are nil. Welcome to the world of bureaucracy.	0	0

The weapon they are using is the multiple exchange rates. Essentially, this conversion of Bolívars into USD facilitates the great import scam by the bourgeoisie. Currency manipulation is being used side-by-side with falsehoods about the importation of food.  This is the kind of economic sabotage that Venezuela is facing from the actions of the capitalist class. Not only are the economic elite siphoning vast amounts money out of the economy, but they’re inflating the prices of essential goods well beyond what they should be. Next time this subject comes up, ask an opponent of the Bolívarian government to explain why prices are so high, and supply is so low.

To cover these costs you need significant market out-performance, which is always pretty difficult to accomplish over the long run.  Just look to any hedge fund out there as an example of how difficult this is to do.  Also the more active management the higher the salaries you need to pay to attract the so-called top level talent.    I'm also cautious about putting too much money into private ownership of infrastructure and into private equity.  The illiquidity of these assets means it's difficult to pin their value, which means these assets become ""worth"" what CPP says they're worth.  This creates another level of non-transparency.  That's not to say CPP should never own assets directly but only to observe that we should be cautious in taking valuations at their word."	0	0

Speaking as a millenial, most of us expect to work hard to afford that first place, and to start with a small property/condo like our parents and grandparents did before us.  The problem now is that even the smallest places in  Vancouver and surrounding burbs are very expensive.  If you're renting (rents are also quite high in Vancouver), it is very difficult to save enough for a down payment when the purchase price is 300k+.  And to those who say, move from Vancouver...when you have lived your whole life here, your family and friends are here, and the jobs are most plentiful here (compared to elsewhere in BC), moving is the last resort option that you try hard to avoid.	0	0

Are any of these concerns on the threshold of being solved or ended?  Last I knew, none of the societal ills mentioned above were partisan issues or the plight of only Democrats or Republicans; they are everyone's problems.

eng_dev_10295	Yep.  I've been a big supporter of Trevor last year and this, and was hoping he'd get the start this year to see if he would grow and blossom into a solid starting QB.  For 2 games it looked good.  But from week 3-on it's been a regression.  As of 2 weeks ago I'd seen enough to change my mind on him getting any better.    Worse yet, his weaknesses are a bad fit for this team's weaknesses.  A physical, scrambling QB might be able to mitigate our pass protection problems some, but those are not Trevor's strengths. Neither is quick read or quick release.  It's just turning into a bad fit.  He doesn't balance out the team's weaknesses, he compounds them.    I hate saying that, but it's just becoming more and more clear.  And it gets worse as teams gameplan to exploit them.  It's just time to try someone else. I just wish they'd made the change last week, with 8 days to prepare for the next game, rather than just 5 now.	0	0

It's another data point that has me suspect about Siemian being anything good like the first couple games we saw during this season.  I think his biggest improvement is to learn to look off the defenders.  Several plays last night he'd lock on his primary right from the snap, coverage would stay tight on that receiver but loosen on the others, and he'd throw right into that tight coverage.  I'm thinking Broncos still don't have their franchise QB.	0	0

eng_dev_10354	I've driven Hondas, Toyotas, bikes, taken the bus/train to work, and owned one BMW and one Merc SUV.  The German brands are more fun to drive. But they depreciate quick. The question is, is it worth it to you for your money to just disappear like that. I've realized the answer to that for us is no. New cars just suck money out of you like there's no tomorrow. We now only own one luxury SUV that is 5 years old, and paid off. That's the family car. We live in the city; sacrificed a large house for a smaller place but more convenient. We only have about 30K on the SUV and have kept it maintained so hopefully maintenance costs don't rise. I take the train to work. It's faster than driving and being stuck in traffic believe it or not. Plus less stress and I can watch Netflix on my phone or do work. We'll keep this thing until maintenance costs really start to rise (at our rate, at least another 7-10 years) and probably buy an electric vehicle next.	0	0

What is baffling to me is why DJJ allowed him to be running loose in the first place if he had an outstanding warrant. They know his address and where he attends school, assuming he does. This may have been prevented, with no party, if he wasn't allowed to be roaming free despite an active warrant that they had and chose not to enforce for whatever reason. An all to common problem in our juvenile justice system - until they get older and the delinquency festers into serious violence against others.   The fact that another minor referred to DJJ for shooting someone tells me he was under the age of 16, otherwise they would have been charged as an adult.

eng_dev_10387	I am going to disagree with you. Choosing not to detain the man at that time is not an admission that they were in the wrong. Based on the information available, the man had not done anything of a threatening nature and did not pose an immediate public danger. However, they did ascertain that he was armed. He violated the law when he refused to comply with a lawful order and it is likely that he will be charged for that crime, as well as have his bail revoked. The fact that doing what he did could have gotten him killed is exactly why APD's actions were noteworthy. They apparently chose to deal with the suspect under more controlled conditions with less risk to the officers, as well as the suspect, rather than escalate a non-threatening contact. We don't know enough to determine whether that WAS indeed the best decision, but I find it very encouraging that a police department is using discretion rather than relying on the show-of-force tactics that so often lead to tragedy.	0	0

Both Comcast and Century Link claim that our internet speed is better but both suffer greatly on speed when the kids come home from school or are off for the summer.

Now I have a nephew who lives in Forks, WA, a little town on the Olympic Peninsula many miles from anywhere, and there they can get 10 MB wired internet service from Comcast even though Puget Sound is between them and any major city in Washington State.

eng_dev_10406	I agree that politicians should be held accountable whenever they are doing something contrary to the good of the country. But here is my question: If Trump's tax plan turns out to benefit him, should we jettison it no matter what? If it hurts Trump, should we accept it no matter what? How about if it is neutral for Trump? It seems to me we should judge any tax plan on whether it is good or bad for the country as a whole, rather than for a specific individual, even if he is the one proposing it. The Democrat's statement of not even considering any tax plan until Trump releases his taxes is therefore nothing but a stalling tactic, knowing they don't have the votes to get their way. They are blatant obstructionists, and having spent the last several years accusing the Republicans of doing the same, they are also hypocrites. Big ones.	1	0

Last year, they used Kershaw in a save situation against the Nationals, deciding game, bottom of the 9th, and he got out of a jam.  Justin Turner’s 3 for 23 in this series, after he hit both the Cubs and Dbacks very well, won’t do. It’s time for him to step it up. Bellinger strikes out too much, the bottom half of the order hit or miss, though Logan Forsythe has quietly had a few key hits. I would assume that Hernandez starts over Joc Pederson, but you never know.  It’s really anyone’s game, should be close, could be decided by a small mistake, including a managerial one.	0	0

Alternately, we can stand by and watch Trump take down the legitimacy of the presidency and the Republican Party for certain, and as appears increasingly likely, the country as well.

eng_dev_10471	Hate crimes in Canada are virtually non-existent. Check Stats Can - for 2013, the average number of hate crimes was 3.3 per 100,000 people in major metropolitan ares. This means that the odds of anyone having a hate crime committed against them are extremely rare. We don't need a government motion (with attached government spending - wasteful!) to condemn Islamophobia (a vague and politically malleable term.)  We deserve the right to criticize Islam. Islam is not only a religion, its a political movement. And all Canadians should strive against the political arm of Islam. We don't want another Rotherham here in Canada due to hate speech laws.  When Imams constantly preach death for those who leave Islam, and the pratice of Taqqiya (lying to non-Muslims) is encourage, and women get stoned to death for getting raped, and gay people get executed just for being gay, then Islamophobia makes sense.  NO on M103. No on C16. Vote out Trudeau in 2019!	1	1

The charitable interpretation is that the Liberals are just trying to create positive publicity in the US for co-operation on border security and other laudable efforts. It seems more likely that this visit by a virulent critic of Trump will be seen by the incoming Trump administration as just another slight directed against the President-Elect by the Trudeau Liberals. After all, Trudeau and his henchtthingies disgraced themselves by their thinly veiled anti-Trump  remarks during the presidential election campaign, when Canada’s self-interest demanded a strict neutrality between the presidential candidates. One of Trump’s famous quotes was: “When a person screws you, you screw them back fifteen times harder.”	0	0

eng_dev_10479	Love all of the other comparisons but where Jeffery's analysis falls apart is in comparing net income.  If an Incorporated Physician has a Net INCOME in their corporation then they would fall into the category of  top billing doctors in Canada.    I am assuming that he meant to say is net revenue of $250,000 from the corporation - from this you would deduct all expenses (rent, staff salaries etc) so the net income would be much lower.  Using an example of 70 % going to expenses - the corps net income would be $ 75,000 - so using the rates listed in his example Business taxes would be $ 13500 (18 % of income).  Now this is before the doctor drew an income - which would further reduce the Corporate income (and Taxes) but would be taxed in the doctor's hands.  May people especially with Doctors confuse Net Billing (revenue) with Net Income.  One does not equal the other	0	0

While the City has put bylaws in place to deal with the green rush that occurred when the VPD said they wouldn't charge dispensaries (2 years ago), very few fit within the framework of the bylaws. Those who do/can, will operate within similar laws as legal states Washington and Colorado. The remaining majority may collect GST, but they likely do NOT report all income. Locations that do not comply with the law will be shut down, deservedly, eventually. Having said that, I think the Manitoba model is miles ahead of Ontario's.

It remains Canada's most influential newspaper (perhaps Canada's only influential newspaper internationally) but papers no longer have the influence on the public and therefore on the politicians that they used to have.    What is far more likely to drive our country into a huge depression is the reckless spending of Justin and The Butts Kissers who seem to be on a determined quest to run the national debt up to $1.5 TRILLION by 2045, thereby enabling Little Potato to pass his papa Big Potato in ruining the fiscal position of the country, hobbling the economy, forcing program cuts just to service the exploding debt and saddling future generations with crippling debt payments.

Re recessionals, they should be fairly simple tunes which can be sung by the congregation and in the case of recessionals, as they are leaving the church (a recessional is after all just that - a recessional). Far too often the ""recessional"" turns out to be a six or even seven stanza hymn which goes on and on and congregation look at their watches after the fourth stanza wondering how long this is going to go on for - completely spoils it.

Hawaii is a vital outpost of the US in the Pacific and a vital part of the US Missile Defense System.

Leaders, or people who claim to be leaders don`t see damage like that and just accept it.   Alcohol is already a double hit on a town and community that is currently dry, with the agony it causes from either being readily available or smuggling, as well as draining income that families could use.    The affects of alcohol cannot be ignored while deaths from other reasons are seen as somehow more tragic. They are all tragic.  I understand the heroin is being given out free at first to get you hooked... and headed down a one-way road that more often than not ends in death.

Actual knowledge comes from reviewing actual documents, reading books on actual history, and being willing to use critical thinking skills.  This big switch narrative that ""Everyone with even a modicum of knowledge knows"" is simply not supported by any data.  Liberals cherish this myth because they must in order to avoid self-examination.  Perfect example,  above the assertion was made that the Republican party opposed the civil rights act of 1964.  I posted links to documentation, government compiled and non-partisan published data from actual house and senate votes.     The record demonstrates that the GOP enthusiastically endorsed LBJ's civil rights push.

eng_dev_10698	There's no shortage at the moment, but it delays the retirement of old tankers, and the high maintenance and operating cost can potentially mean the overall costs to the USAF are slightly higher as a result, especially if any KC-135's need to have additional maintenance checks as a result. If, somehow, we ended up in a major conflict, there could potentially be a shortage to support the mission rate the Air Force might otherwise fly.  It's not a big worry, and most of us were expecting some delays, but the schedule slide is still disappointing.  @ KeepSimple - Some flights can be long, especially since the tankers are often used for cargo duties in addition to refueling, but the tankers don't fly nearly as many hours per year as commercial 767's do, so the savings aren't as high.  A more cynical speculation is that perhaps Boeing determined they would still comply with the performance in their bid without the winglets, and left them off solely to keep the cost down.	0	0

eng_dev_10733	The reason that Obamacare is so popular is that only 7% of the US population gets their medical insurance from the Obamacare exchanges. 49% of the US population gets health insurance through their employer (the percentage is even higher in Hawaii). With employer coverage, you never need to buy an individual policy on the Obamacare exchanges. The employer provided insurance is part of a group rate insurance program from private carriers that cuts premiums because it is a very large pool of insured to spread risk. The employer gets a tax credit to pay for the employer's paying a share of premiums for employees (employers like providing this benefit). Employees get a tax break-- yes we are all Federally subsidized--employees are not taxed on the employer's paying a portion of the employee's health insurance.

No! Not allowed because such fundraising is prohibited for “items that are publicly funded”.    Yet, many parents who can afford it are spending considerable bucks on private tutoring in the basics such as Math and Reading.  And tutoring companies are a growth industry!

But I guess he didn't want to be on the wrong side of that issue.   Most recently, he's stood up and opposed John Tory's road tolls proposal. Okay, he may argue he opposes tax increases (or new taxes) in general. But then if he's going around trying to 'cut taxes', what does that say about what he's likely going to do with OHIP?

eng_dev_10793	It feels like the time has come for a third party. The Hawaii democratic party has become such corporate pawns that they no longer care about representing the will of the people. Take the Democratic Preference Poll for example, our primary. The people of Hawaii voted 70% for Bernie Sanders yet only 2 of our 10 super delegates voted in a way as to reflect the vote of those of us they are supposed to represent. Schatz and Hirono proudly voted for Hillary. I believe Ige did too, although upon calling his office to ask that question they said they didn't know how he cast his super delegate vote. Really?! Tulsi and our new Chair person Tim Vandeveer cast their super delegate votes as we wished and asked them to with our votes. So who are these elected people working for? Thought they were  there to represent us. Guess not, they work for the corporate establishment obviously. To be fair there are times that I agree with their stances, but I think they need replacing with true progressives.	0	0

The lead Canon Lawyer; one of three priests present, went on to become the Primate of All-Ireland & Archbishop of Armagh Sean Brady. He later subjected Brendan to 13 years of legal frustration in the hope that he would give up on his civil action against Brady; who settled up on the steps of the courthouse, to prevent the public exposure in an open court.

eng_dev_10907	Watch the video of the brief interlude between a young, talented player and a Hall of Fame coach. It was respectful both ways. The player's own coach has had issues with him that haven't been publicized. It wasn't a cheap shot for an opposing coach with lots of experience trying to manage his own players' behavior to offer a few words of advice. Maybe he was surprised that the exchange wasn't kept private, the way stuff in the locker room stays in the locker room, because his reaction was peculiar. Still, I think Brooks got the message nonetheless.  A No. 1 seed is respect. Beating two teams that wouldn't draw crowds over 6,000 in Eugene on a rainy December night only got Oregon a feature spread in Sports Illustrated. More respect.

fin_dev_96	Valehdellut neitsyyden menettämisestä 12 vuotiaana  Moi oon nyt 14 vuotias tyttö ja kuten otsikossa lukee niin oon valehdellu kaikille mun frendeille että olisin menettänyt neitsyyteni 12 vuotiaana. Tosiasia on se että olen vielä neitsyt mutta ketään kavereistani ei ole. Kaikilla kavereillani on ollut vähintään 6kk sama kumppani ja he ovat harrastaneet jonkinlaista seksiä. Mua ahdistaa ihan hirveesti kun ne puhuu vaan siitä mitä ne on tehny kumppaniensa kanssa yms. Mun tekis mieli kertoo niille että oon oikeesti vielä neitsyt mutta pelkään (taino tiiän) että ne suuttuu mulle ja sit mä oisin viel yksinäisempi mitä olen nyt.  Eli mitä mun pitäis tehdä jatkaa valehtelua vai kertoa totuus ja tulla yksinäiseksi?	0	0

Kantakaa toistenne kuormia, ja niin te täytätte Kristuksen lain. 3. Sillä jos joku luulee jotakin olevansa, vaikka ei ole mitään, niin hän pettää itsensä. 4. Mutta tutkikoon kukin omat tekonsa, ja silloin hänen kerskaamisensa on vain siinä, mitä hän itse on, ei siinä, mitä toinen on; 5. sillä kunkin on kannettava oma taakkansa. 6.

Joka lihaansa kylvää, se lihasta turmeluksen niittää; mutta joka Henkeen kylvää, se Hengestä iankaikkisen elämän niittää. 9. Ja kun hyvää teemme, älkäämme lannistuko, sillä me saamme ajan tullen niittää, jos emme väsy. 10. Sentähden, kun meillä vielä aikaa on, tehkäämme hyvää kaikille, mutta varsinkin uskonveljille.  11.

ger_dev_1962	Palmer und #Maaßen sind die besten Beispiele, das die Wörter #rassist #nazi #Antisemit fast nur noch gebraucht werden, um Andersdenkende und Kritiker zu denunzieren und mundtot zu machen. Dieser politische Missbrauch schadet allen.  #palmer #PalmerRassist https://t.co/NeB2YnoS2L	0	0

ger_dev_1969	@christian_neef Ich habe eher den Eindruck das die Tagesschau zu einer Propaganda-Sendung mutiert. Statt Nachrichten gab es Heute Werbung für eine Serie über Sophie Scholl.
