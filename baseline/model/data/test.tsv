eng_test_0	Hey hick the 70s called and they want their jean jacket back 😆
eng_test_1	Kailua sucks: Dam n overpopulation , horrible traffic, overcrowded beach and no parking and house prices driven up by dam n overpopulation. Immigration sucks.
eng_test_2	Y'all pull your head out of your ass. Transgender women are not going to hurt you or your children. It's just yur ignorance about other people that puts fear into yur thick skulls. Yur just pissed off cuz you lost the LBGT fight in the supreme court. It's the transgender girls that need protection from you.
eng_test_3	No, greed is to live in a home built from wood, and then advocate depriving others of a home built of wood, because the vulgar hypocrite thinks all logging is evil, except when it came to building a home for them.
eng_test_4	If someone tells you up front that they are an entertainer or an advocate you know that they are trying to persuade you to point of view. That's fine because you can accept it or not. On the other had we have comedians criticizing politicians and then saying "Just Funning". At least the KKK doe's not say they are 'Fair & Balanced'.
eng_test_5	"Faith healing" should be in quotes. There's nothing "healing" about it
eng_test_6	He does??  The smiley faces emoticon is typically used for three reasons... 1). Something is genuinely funny; 2). To convey "your remark is ridiculous.  I think you're an idiot," and 3). A not-so-subtle form of bullying.  The first reason is pretty much rarely used on this site.
eng_test_7	Excellent dose of reality revealing the stupidity of every Republican policy.  Time for Revolution NOW!
eng_test_8	"For now, the House GOP's health care plan would provide each state a fixed sum for each beneficiary – no matter how much or little of the costs that funding covered."  This proposal hurts high-cost states like Alaska the most, as states with low health care costs would get the same amount per person as those in high cost states.  The former would get more funding than they need, and the latter would get less.  Sad!
eng_test_9	Good to know that the Alaska Republican Party officially condones racism, anti- Muslim and anti-Mexican statements, and misogynistic statements- including lots of disgusting comments about women before the so -called "locker room tapes" became public.   Good luck with that.
eng_test_10	Norway has stupidly high carbon taxes and nowhere to drive anyway.
eng_test_11	Looking at the Facebook posts, it appears this young man thought he was Mario Andretti.  Too bad he lost his life he was a pretty popular guy and by all appearances on Facebook a pretty decent kid.
eng_test_12	My facts came from the same place you got your 1000 vote pickup in 2014.  Back that up with actual facts, I dare ya.  Also if "TEA is ...not a party and has no representation" then anyone claimng they picked up 1000 seats in the 2014 election must have their head up their rump.  Wouldn't you agree?
eng_test_13	Maybe if your son is so stupid he is dangerous for the country you should have him institutionalized for everyone's safety.
eng_test_14	POMPOUS MORON TRUMP IS A "BAD DEAL" FOR AMERICA
eng_test_15	And gravity should be adjustable so that heavy things should be easy to lift.
eng_test_16	how is a war illegal? dumbest thing I ever heard.
eng_test_17	Anti-feminist?  you are ****ing crazy.  Have a good day.
eng_test_18	Nees you always crack me up.  Always confirming, with your snide fact bereft comments, why voters have rejected you twice now.
eng_test_19	But he is, Blanche! He is a racist!
eng_test_20	Right. Kill the messenger.  Hit a little too close to home?
eng_test_21	With the PFD purse wide open, the raid will be lengthy, and deep! Idiots!
eng_test_22	I've never seen such a corrupt bunch of poor losers......! Losers....!! Ha !!
eng_test_23	No mention of this on the CBC website: no room for national security and our relationship with the US- it's all Trump impeachment stories and Trudeau selfies.
eng_test_24	Did I just read that a company bought themselves a 650,000 dollar job for 56k?......  What a bunch of crooks.
eng_test_25	You are a f.cking idiot. The Whole Country knows that the BC Carbon tax was created in BC when Campbell removed the bank capital tax have you been in a coma?
eng_test_26	Living next door and having access to 50% of the largest auto market in the world sounds pretty good to me.   Now Canada should reciprocate and give  the US access to 50% of Canada's dairy and chicken market.  Do I hear cries of "Oh, No...."
eng_test_27	That sounds like a great way to drum up some extra revenue. The key will setting the fines just right. They need to be high enough to make it the endeavor profitable, yet low enough so as to not drastically decrease the number of people getting caught running red lights.
eng_test_28	What is this worth in reference to this article?
eng_test_29	Muldoon and Harper shared the same proclivity.
eng_test_30	Ut extra sic intra.
eng_test_31	How many black soldiers died so you can post this bullshit? Fucktard
eng_test_32	For Russians posting here: it is "quotation," not quote. The latter (i.e. to quote) is a verb.. To cite something someone has said is properly referred to as a quotation (a noun). No charge for the English lesson. That said who cares what the KGB man in the Kremlin has to say about anything? He's a liar.
eng_test_33	Yesterday it was 50 deaths.  Today it is 49.  Glad to see that one recovered from their demise.
eng_test_34	Of course they did. They're not stupid like Trumpnuts.
eng_test_35	Commentaire  You and Catou really should learn how to use Globe and Mail's stock page.   BNS traded at $2.75 (split adjusted - just sayin') in 1982, 1984 & 1990.   I doubt SFI is lying.  After conversing with him for at least 5 years, I have learned his posts are credible.  Like it or not.
eng_test_36	You are a bloody idiot. Water does NOT create mercury into water, however the tailing ponds and the OIL/ BITUMEN itself KILLS INSTANTLY - wildlife, people (hundreds died living near the oil sands loaded with chemical in the water producing deformed fish/food) and produces birth defects and CANCER.
eng_test_37	What no one can answer is what is the plan to dispose of these bio-hazards in 6-7 years when their batteries are dead, the paint is faded, and the interior smells?  Do we really want thousand of these cars abandoned all over our islands?  Who is going to pay to dispose of the dead batteries?  Ah, the unintended consequences!
eng_test_38	McDow, we can agree to disagree but independents and republicans far out number democrats and progressives in Alaska, and it is this factor Walker was elected. Just saying.... So which of the big three does Walker want to buy out with your dividend?
eng_test_39	Steve...I think it's the same "scapegoat" phenomena, that Trump played to with such vigor....presenting  the Trumpies with someone to hate....ie "bad hombres" uppity women like Hillary,   et al.....to the tune of "lock her up" build a wall....et al.....what totally mistifies me is how institutional hierarchy was so dumb as to support this man?  Evil doesn't change all that much..does it?
eng_test_40	You mean their interpretation of their belief system.
eng_test_41	.....says a Floridian looking to suck the lifeblood out of Alaska.
eng_test_42	he is only popular with low information voters and millennials, thinking people want no part of him.
eng_test_43	Wonderful story - and now the State wants to tax her meager wages while all retirement income (like mine) is exempted.  You can't make this stuff up.............
eng_test_44	Providence charges ALL employees for the providence run daycare facility. It is NOT free. The waiting list is infinitely long and the only employees able to afford it are the directors of departments or the well paid clinical staff like nurses and doctors.
eng_test_45	Antarctic sea ice is also at an all-time low for this day of the year, same with the Arctic. That means, of course, that global sea ice extent is at an all-time low for this day of the year. What’s surprising is just how low it is. The planet is changing, a lot faster than we want it to.  https://tamino.wordpress.com/2016/11/17/sea-ice-north-and-south/
eng_test_46	idiot with a voice
eng_test_47	Fire that loser, get someone in there with a good head on his shoulders, isn't that General Flynn at loose ends?
eng_test_48	B. Carfree -- Got to keep serving up the hate don't you?
eng_test_49	OK What is it about? Nobody can answer. Kapernick wears kill cop socks. Is that the protest? Kill cops? Plus it all started when Obama was president so now it's about Trump? I never heard Brandon Marshall explain why he was kneeling. These guys look stupid in that they're now standing like everybody has forever and somehow that's a gesture of unity? None of it ever made sense.
eng_test_50	Brett .. should she have announce it and get kidnapped?   Anyway who cares you should meet everybody meeting people does not mean you agree! So Hart should not meet trump?
eng_test_51	Hillary is a liar.  What more needs to be said?  We all know she is a liar and she will always lie.
eng_test_52	So, by your "logic," any person of color who doesn't publically admonish gang members and refuse to live by the Snitches Get Stitches code, they are all "thug criminals."  Same, same, right?  Is that your argument?
eng_test_53	Actually, you would be completely wrong, Mister woman-hating, right wing, Caucasian male.  Just because most right wing Caucasian males have Mommy Issues and hate powerful, take-no-guff women does NOT mean normal Americans do not want to hear Hillary's 'take.' What NO normal, Trump-opposing American cares about ... drum roll for the Trumpty Dumpties ... is the pathetic sexist opinions of another woman-hating, right wing, Caucasian male.  Go tell your Mommy your pasty boy tales and whines, Wegmann.
eng_test_54	are you for real? this is the stupidest bias nonsense that makes our science a joke! no lets not hire the best person, no, lets pick from the woman list etc, you nut jobs are the real problem in canada
eng_test_55	What a scumbag, mercilessly killing a 3 year old, death would be too good for him, because when he faces his judgment day it will be followed with an express elevator down or non-existence.
eng_test_56	Where are the parents?
eng_test_57	When even Fox has an article about the un-Constitutional, sue threatening, wimp trump: http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/27/trump-wants-to-weaken-libel-laws-amid-feuds-with-reporters.html
eng_test_58	Oops, I just responded to your false comment...sorry!!!  How does one do  usurp another user's name? Surely Civil Comment's does't allow someone to create a 2nd version of an already existing user name?
eng_test_59	Do we have to keep filling up within 100 miles of the US/Canada border so we are like countries where you can't go two feet without stepping on someone ?  Canada for all intents and purposes have enough people and continued computerization and robotization won't make matters better.  Trudeau gets an "F" for increased debt and carbon taxes, addicting our young kids with pot, giving our money away to the UN for tinpot dictators to buy villas, and for going on vacation all the time and not spending enough time creating real jobs, not government debt-fuelled ones which only steal from the future generations.
eng_test_60	Yes, the clown like, flightless birds now make me wanna puke.  Totally gutless
eng_test_61	When is the next federal election?  I have gotten to the point where just looking at this silly little boy's face or hearing his  lisping sanctimonious voice makes me furious.
eng_test_62	I gave you a like, Philly--there's nothing funny about what you say, I believe it's true.  That's what "civil" means.    Interesting, but, in order to have my own comment reach this electronic page,  when I read someone else's well-stated, literate comment which does not insult anyone and contains no derogatory words--four-letter or longer--I often STILL have to remind myself it is "civil" and say so.    Howcum?  Because the comment can be ignorant.  It can be misguided.  It can be   stupid or fatuous, too.  BUT it is "civil."  So the "ratings" mean "be polite."  That's big in Canada; what we're known for.
eng_test_63	Mauicitizen  No one is forced to do anything in regard to water fluoridation.  If you knew that your tap water was contaminated with significant amounts of cyanide, would you still drink it simply because it flowed from your faucet, or would you obtain your water from another source?  Inconvenience, regardless the degree, does not constitute force.  Steven D. Slott, DDS
eng_test_64	Dumber the comments, more popular they are with the left.
eng_test_65	Can you say Liberal slush fund, what a stupid idea. Try controlling your spending
eng_test_66	Who gives a flying freak about what Kim and Park are making or not making? Really? This is what the SA chooses to write editorials about?
eng_test_67	The communist Obama care, 600,000 people forced to sign up, even though they don't like it, because they have to help pay for the illegals medical care.
eng_test_68	and another hate filled loser spews the stupidity, jealous of his obviously.  hey dummy under thier system he won by a majority,, just like the libs did here and not getting the majority of the vote, so its ok for the libs here to win such but not trump? man the left are as full of bs as ever
eng_test_69	No, no, no!    Haven't you been keeping up?  Trump is now confirming that man-made climate change is a fact.  It's being caused by radical Islamic terrorists.
eng_test_70	I think your last statement is the answer to its own question. Canada has a trade imbalance with China (as does virtually every major economy) and free trade can help reduce or eliminate that. China has to open its economy to outside companies and investors. To right the imbalance, trade has to flow both ways.
eng_test_71	I was in Kodiak when they decided to institute a parking 'tax' at the airport.  It now costs more to collect this than is put in.  Most people drop off the travellers at the airport now so collecting a few dollars Dailey then paying someone to collect it is a lose lose situation.  This is what is happening now with weed, it costs more to administer it than is collected in taxes.
eng_test_72	Trump should be impeached immediately by the Congress of the United States to demonstrate that the American Constitution, for which men and women have fought and died, can withstand a heinous moron from the world of reality television. How did this creature ever finagle his way into the presidency?  And this is happening in several countries - populism. BS!!!
eng_test_73	Ms. Rodell should insist that any money taken from dividends be loans from the people that will be paid back by the state when the state digs itself out of the fiscal ditch we find ourselves in.
eng_test_74	They're doing their darnedest to declare any amount of booze harmful, despite decades of of evidence showing that moderate drinking is associated with lower mortality from all causes. And I'm sure they'll eventually succeed. It might even be true -- who knows.  Meanwhile, there are those of us who recognize that — when it comes to your own body — "good" is what you make it. There are some folks out there willing to sacrifice any corporeal pleasures for a small gain in mental acuity or longevity, and then there are others prepared to give up a certain amount of those for the enjoyment of a drink every now and then.  Prescribing one preference function for the entire population (as tempting as this is for control freaks) misses the point. It's about choice.
eng_test_75	I was in Golden a month ago. Nobody likes to lose their view but it is becoming an urban environment. That isn't going to change.   It is generally true that if you live in an urban environment you usually don't have a view, unless you can pay for it. NYC, LA, Boston, Miami, ect. It comes with dense urbanization.   When cities minimize vertical space it incentives developers to build horizontally to fill out the maximum dwelling units that zoning will allow. We end up with these cereal box looking buildings that push the setbacks on all sides of the lot. The result is minimal open space on the parcel.    Taller buildings with smaller footprints leave more lot room for amenities and open space at the base. That is just how urbanization works. Encouraging smaller footprints, and taller builds at least leaves space on the lot for some green for residents. Build them now and lock in the open space or lose that potential some point in the future.
eng_test_76	Thank you Ms. Clarkson for this thoughtful column. As the child of immigrants from Scotland after the war we had the advantage of the language and my father had training in the Royal Navy as an engineer. He upgraded at our cities technical college in the evenings (during the day his job was tearing up trolley car tracks for the railway). Like many if not most Canadians, I have sympathy for the plight of the indigenous people. Driving through the core of our city I sometimes see toddlers of aboriginal descent out on the sidewalks by themselves and not properly clothed for our climate. I've often thought to myself, what chance do they have? They haven't chosen to live in these circumstances. Yet when I see reports of life on isolated reserves with suicide and substance dependence issues I wonder if this is the way our country should be continuing. I also think that there are some in the indigenous community who have a stake in the continuity of this system. Maybe it's time for change.
eng_test_77	It will be drained once we get rid of Trump. He's a total incompetent. Trump will be forced to resign once he's exposed of all his illegal dealings with Russia. The guy is a liar. Just like Hillary. Pence will be the next president.
eng_test_78	why yes, more taxes is the answer to the utter stupidity going on in city govt. why didn't the rest of us think of that.
eng_test_79	JV:  Anyone who allows ADN to influence their choice on anything is foolish.
eng_test_80	Are you fucking crazy?   I will NEVER back that asshole.   I say put him on the DMZ and leave the asshole there.
eng_test_81	Congratulations on being the dump for America's trash. US Border Patrol is once again laughing at the baffled Canadians
eng_test_82	The story is a bit unclear in where they work.  Are they in uniform while playing?  Are they on company property?  That bit of info might help discern if the boss is justified.  The next legal question is who owns the lunch hour?  If the employee is unpaid during lunch, how does the boss have control (uniform and property issues aside)?
eng_test_83	You are preaching to the converted, with me. Nothing worse than a cold bottom, and winter becomes a delightful season if all your bits stay warm. I can exercise or walk to work until minus 25 if I have layers. Probably down to minus 35, but really, what's the point. Discovered that I can tuck my dresses into snow pants, with long johns pulled over my nylons, and give myself a quick touch up once I reach the office. Way more fun walking than spending 10 minutes s scraping a car, while wearing inadequate clothes at either end of the commute. In the end, I notice the cold less while walking than while waiting for a car to warm up.
eng_test_84	"Obviously over the hill?" Not so sure. But I confess I have not seen much of Kings games nor Iggy this year. Kopitar is on a minor streak, over the past 3 games anyway.   My Canucks would dearly love to be in the Kings position! I am with Goat. The problem seems to be more at the goalie position. Maybe they should have traded with the Canucks for Miller.
eng_test_85	Great article!  ...He's a Class Act.  I wish more stars could be such great role models.
eng_test_86	Doug Saunders would love the days of Chairman Mao when, in the spirit of total equality,  everyone* had nothing.  *apart from select government apparatchiks
eng_test_87	Are you picking up on the fact this issue is just about to enter its' third week, and is not going away?  Are you aware that 61% of Liberals do not support this deal?
eng_test_88	A dangerous fiction put out by the left is that all Muslims are peace-loving...they point out the peaceful Ismailis and totally ignore Wahhabi fundamentalists. You know...the ones that call Ismailis heretics and believe in stoning adulterers and homosexuals to death.
eng_test_89	Oh, and if he is "fighting the NRA" it makes him less of a scumbag? Typical liberal perspective. He is someone that the Democrats should not accept a penny from and should distance themselves.
eng_test_90	Okay, I won't beat around the bush, You're an ass hole
eng_test_91	Here we go again, tap-dancing through a minefield towards WW3.
eng_test_92	You've jumped the shark now.
eng_test_93	Does Erik the author ever fly on an airplane or use hydrocarbons?  He is a hypocrite
eng_test_94	First off, I am happy I was not hallucinating when I was telling people, after the FTA came down with it's dictum, that rail was no longer a issue that would decide the Mayoral race. So for that, thank you Dr. Milner.   And with that, I would just like to add to Dr. Milner's points about this race being more about the fundamentals. Basically, outside of being a better master of disaster, which really comes down to judging management styles, this race will become, if it already has, about even more basic bread-and-butter issues like who has a better plan for repaving the roads or more efficient garbage services, or how property taxes will be calculated once elected. You know, issues that make many yawn.   The only issue that I could see that may inspire some to interest is that of economic development in the C&C. Fasi and Harris used that angle at times to spur interest in the voters, but both these candidates are leaving that on the table.
eng_test_95	I'll watch it on TV but not at the stadium.  However, if it's going to be a 'runaway' game, then I would change the channel.  Sorry UH and good luck this season.
eng_test_96	Don't hate yourself, but ASK yourself how she can be so tone-deaf to the optics here.  "Come-f***-me pumps"?  Really?  Even for a helicopter ride?  Another day, another gaffe.
eng_test_97	The globe only rag I know of that's on their kness for trudope. Time we dump this useless rag. It might be okay if NK can hit  Toronto or anything in that useless welfare Eastern Canada, then the real men in the West will clean up the mess. Just a lot less scum  to support.
eng_test_98	Right. And that's just what Trump wants Canada to do - double it's expenditure on the military.
eng_test_99	Ridiculous.  Forget it. You will lose the election if you sell out to these murderous, greedy pr&%cks  NO deal
eng_test_100	No.  Trump adopted the phrase 'America First' because it was an old racist Nazi buzzword from years ago. It was a dog-whistle siren call to his white supremacist brethren. Then Bannon spewed out some word salad for Trump to further butcher in an attempt to deny it. They came up with the empty 'isolationism' that Trump immediately denied when he met with Merkel. Trump never had any foreign policy, other than looking to skim money wherever he could. He's a petty con man, not an actual reasoned or sane human being, he's a fraud. He's imbalanced, unfit for office. Now we have a weak and insecure, belligerent child who imagines himself a fascist saviour. He's no more than an egotistical juvenile buffoon. We need to remove him from the office, get him out of office now.  Trump is a white supremacist, Nazi sympathizer who should be removed from office.
eng_test_101	Lloyd.
eng_test_102	And yet nowhere visible is a comment from you marked as being u n c i v i l which is what happens when the process is a result of other posters ranking the comment.
eng_test_103	Yu can blame barack obama for this one.  He could have fixed this last week but failed again.  really stupid.
eng_test_104	You will not win...go away!
eng_test_105	This information can be released, with the names changed to John Doe#1 etc.  This should be acceptable to Civil Beat, unless they have a different agenda.
eng_test_106	You keep trying to belittle the fact that he had a nervous breakdown. You are vastly ignorant by calling it "was sad".  Ignorance never stopped you, eh? Somehow you equate being able to pool scant resources with long-term employability.  When was the last time you went looking for a job?   Then you move on "hundreds of junkies", claiming they chose addiction. Some, sure. But it looks like you missed the Pulitzer Prize winning series in The Seattle Times about how opioid prescribing excess and sudden withholding is driving agonized patients to alternate drugs. Could be you someday, be careful. Yes, institutionalization is appropriate.  Odom has a supervised situation with standards now. You reveal your "desire to drive them...out of state".  Feel the same about developmentally delayed adults? Violent head-injury victims too? PTSD mumblers? Your fears and subsequent hatred of mental illnesses that you still don't comprehend shows your vile attitude. Your choice. Or volunteer and learn.
eng_test_107	I suspect only Makhosi said NO to Zuma, the rest are nothing!
eng_test_108	That is a bunch of arrogant bull, just like the mayor and City's bull.
eng_test_109	I agree with you but unfortunately the majority of Democrats are also in the pockets of the rich and powerful corporate interests. There are some Democrats though who actually care and who are fighting against that so at least there's hope.
eng_test_110	actually, many would love to see a statue of Joseph McCarthy.   he got rid of all those blood stained commies and queers!
eng_test_111	I got into this fray with racists and bigots on Civil Comments after a young Native girl said on these poor-ass pages that a friend of hers, another young Native girl, committed suicide after reading some of the anti-Native trash on these pages. In the meantime it is my duty to keep standing my ground and push back against ya'lls as much as I can.
eng_test_112	If you don't like Vatican II, I suggest you head over to the Pius X Society.
eng_test_113	I agree that Kuhl's pitch was intentional. That's what happens when you hit a team's best player... accidental or not. Especially the day after FOUR Pirates got hit. Not saying the Rockies did it intentionally, but at some point a team has to protect their players and establish a consequence for not "mastering command" yet. And again... 5 Pirates were hit and didn't charge the mound. One Rockie got brushed back and did. Perspective.
eng_test_114	KTVA has always been superior.
eng_test_115	Most employers would love to quadruple what they pay in pension costs, give their employees an additional 10 weeks of vacation, give them 7 days per year to write reports, force their employees to work an entire 4 hours per day on the days that they are not on vacation or using up their 120 sick days.  Yeah, I could see a market for this!
eng_test_116	That's rubbish, nothing but dyspeptic digestive gas. Your bad temper has gotten the better of you, once again. That has nothing to do with me.
eng_test_117	"Crook, bum, clown, cheat, liar, sneak, opportunist, and carpetbagger" You nailed that one...  Couldn't have described the Clintons any better...
eng_test_118	Exaggerate much?   I just spent two months traveling in BC Alberta Sask and Manitoba. Yes BC is the most expensive, but only 10-15 cents more than Ontario at best.  Saskatchewan is the cheapest, followed by Manitoba then Alberta. I've still got all the receipts.
eng_test_119	Wow. Trudeau suggests that he will finally abolish the Indian Act - something that conservative Rebel Media personality Ezra Levant has been pushing for years.  But let's wait and see if it's real change or just new lipstick on the same old pig.
eng_test_120	I suggest to think over one simple question: if we leave North Korea alone, what will happen? Do you really think North Korea will strike at its Korean neighbour on the South? or send its puny "ICBM"s  in the direction of the US?  You may be surprised by the actual answer but it is as simple as that: nothing will happen! Surely, we will continue feel a pity to the enslaved population of North Korea, but it is all we can (and should) be doing. We do not need any drum beat - just very pointy sanctions. We do not need to deploy thousands and thousands of new troops along with all that weaponry on the Korean peninsula - we already have enough to thwart their questionable military supremacy over South Korea. Let the dictator and his clique to engulf themselves - this will surely take less time and (our) money ...
eng_test_121	Kudos to law enforcement and the community for finding this RAT ...
eng_test_122	ask allie!  she knows....!
eng_test_123	So now you're all fake concerned about using real names? That's gonna come as a huge surprise to your fellow trolls.
eng_test_124	Wavey:  Liar, nothing but a sore loser.
eng_test_125	There absolutely is something wrong with this guy to blame this on our POTUS.....most likely he is either carrying a grudge like an immature 8th grader or he's also running for president in 2020 and he thinks this will give him bonus points with the liberals......what a moron
eng_test_126	Only a fool would not agree that the country is in deep kukae with the most inept bunch of characters supposedly leading the country. Time for a major overhaul before the damage cannot be undone.
eng_test_127	Brian They don't give a damn who you are, Learn a lesson in humility,  There is just as many and more important poor people that should be released, Take a lesson and stop dealing with China all together, But it's idiots like you with lots of money who do the wrong thing by getting involved with tyrants. or bloody communist dictators,  learn your history !  If idiots like you never approached them in any way, you would never had these complications, Sift this out yourself and leave the rest of Canada alone, and that goes double for you Trudeau ! Stop playing footsies with them and get everyone out of there, Stop trying to make foolish deals with a country that makes poor quality products and wants to take over the world,
eng_test_128	I challenge your presupposition that these things can only be done through taxation and the state.
eng_test_129	But sidewalks, which are required by code are paid by the property owner.
eng_test_130	Social policies have conditioned people to expect they'll get things for free, gratis and nothing - the entitlement culture that's a bane of post-1994 SA. Mandela promise free houses pre-1994. The need may have been there but it was an irresponsible and unrealistic promise to make because which society anywhere at any time has been free of need, and expects government to provide everything? It became policy and the consequences are the Grootboom and Marikana decisions. At the moment beneficiaries receive a serviced dwelling and plot. BNG and self-build options are almost never heard of. Why? Rentals were tried at N2 Gateway Project but after it opened tenants refused to pay, I think R600pm-plus. I don't know what happened later.  You're being unrealistic or disingenuous saying people must contribute. That's not South African's way re social services. And poverty is still increasing, indicating the current model's broken (see Ivan Turok's recent article in The Conversation).
eng_test_131	Don't waste time reading the article "A source says somebody somewhere did something illegal and they might tell us on Monday or Tuesday, if they can find that somebody."  Seriously, is there no real news?
eng_test_132	Sore loser. Get outta here with your socialist drivel, chump.
eng_test_133	Lori has always been an amazing instructor, friend, mentor, to so very many students and staff over the years!! I wish her the best in all future endeavors!
eng_test_134	When you create 100k jobs and pay half a billion in taxes every year  you can as well
eng_test_135	Shut your pie hole.
eng_test_136	I can’t imagine a cruder analysis and to totally ignore the difficulties of integration/assimilation and the receptivity of established communities is folly. If you want an object lesson of the inadvisability of massive immigration in a short period just look at Germany in the last few years. Social tensions there are skyhigh and seems like Canada is now wanting to take on similar percentages as the germans.
eng_test_137	Trump should have waited until Sessions had been confirmed. It was utterly moronic not to have a loyal deputy in place when trying to pass such dubious garbage.
eng_test_138	31 GMs who did you miss?
eng_test_139	The polls are never accurate, Trump is not perfect but he is far better than clinton
eng_test_140	And that is how an on-line discussion/debate should take place, both parties making actual commentary with the second party making an intelligent, well thought out response; not low effort name calling.  Good points Skyline, good points, very economic of you, but fair on all counts :).
eng_test_141	Probably some oriental guy.  LOL.
eng_test_142	This narcissist just can’t get over the fact that he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. Everything is about size with Trump, size of his hands, size of his junk, size of the crowds at the inauguration. It bothers him to no end. It’s all about him being the best, being number one, him being at center stage towering over his opponents. Instead of focusing on the job at hand, after all he is President, he won the election. He continues as if he is still on the campaign trail. The other day even in front of the CIA wall of honour for fallen CIA agents he continued to whine and boast about the size of his crowd and the awful media. This is the pure definition of being a narcissist. Trump needs psychological help.
eng_test_143	no, but it was stupid
eng_test_144	So these Idiots are trumps fault? Lord help us all...Please,Please stay in school!!
eng_test_145	Get a life Miller...   Troll
eng_test_146	First thing you've got right on this thread!
eng_test_147	Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton work against the interests of everything I care about. They are evil. I hate them. What's sad is not my hate, but that Steve doesn't realize what they've done to us.
eng_test_148	Is that how you define blatant lies now, "transparency?"  Oh, right. I forgot you live in Buzarro land where everything the Pathological Liar and his pathologically lying mouth pieces say is twisted around and propagandize as "truth."   Or Fake News, as the sideshow freak you elected would scream it.
eng_test_149	welcome to DEMOCRACY and just another president using his authorities granted under their constitution you ignorant left winger of hate
eng_test_150	It's time alt right Canadians unite and kick pothead out of office, then throw  these parasites into the ocean. Pothead has said all those that fought and died for Canada and our freedoms were stupid, just like his daddy did and  his blood thirsty mommy.
eng_test_151	Trumplethinskin's face must still be hurting from the *****slap he got from Qassim al-Rimi "Ha Ha you missed me fool!" Yemen has now banned all US Spec. Ops Mission fail! Bigly!
eng_test_152	Pre represents Track at the University, not a dorm.  If anything along with the statue of Bowerman, there should be one of Pre.  Hayward Field and Pre are met for one another, just like Bowerman.
eng_test_153	Which, of course, explains his election.  http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/11/opinions/trump-news-conference-stanley/index.html  He is interested in what works, not in making statements so high-minded only bats can hear them (Obama), or repeating memorized canned responses (Hillary),  or anything of the sort to present the press corps with grist for their mills.  The public absolutely hates the media, he knows it, and they don't.
eng_test_154	Compact and cryptic, I like it.  "Bored now."  Could be an expression of personal angst; could be a comment on the author's apparent paucity of subject material; could be an observation about the general readership fallout...
eng_test_155	I don't care what people like you believe. I'm just setting the record straight for all of the saints who are perfect and never made any bad choices in their life (at least that's the way they speak, as if they're perfect) I don't want my baby girl having to see all of the ugly things a lot of people have said about her loving father. so think what you want, you do already. Lol. I sure hope that no one you care about ever has shortcomings through out their life, that would be tragic........
eng_test_156	True, but a bit misleading.  Oregon has exemptions of $7.5M for timber and farmlands, with reduced rates up to $15M.  There are also significant reductions for family businesses.
eng_test_157	Where all the deport people at. This guy isn't hispanic or Muslim. Most likely a white Christian male and its crickets in here but if you listen to Trump band of can't think for themselves morons you would think crime is only done by Hispanic and Muslim people. This guy stole a lot of money. Still 2 million he has not paid back. So many wanted the guy who justbgot pardoned for the video store robbery to be in jail for life but this guy stole alot more dinero. They are such hippocrits
eng_test_158	Wake up CANADA, wake up. Justin is a traitor. He is selling us out to China for his own interest only.
eng_test_159	At least the Americans have a true representative democracy.  Unlike here in Canada where asymmetrical federalism have made second class citizens out of 75% of its population. Of course, to our credit , we do have fearless leader in Flewdeau .  Now what was that Monty Python saying ?  Ah yes.  How sweet to be an idiot.
eng_test_160	And yet Europe has a lower homicide rate than the USA.    What is your solution to the problems in the USA - a military coup?
eng_test_161	You support terrorists and traitors.
eng_test_162	what an idiot you are,, see nut job, these are the lefty lunatic courts and they are as usual going to be overturned at the SC level,,
eng_test_163	Tory is completely right on this one. Toronto needs more ways to raise revenue and getting compensation from the drivers who use these expensive motorways makes a ton of sense. It also aligns with other changes the city would like to make anyway- decreasing congestion, improving air quality etc. And that is coming from someone who uses those roads a lot.  Wynne is going down next election anyway. She may as well do the right thing in the interim.
eng_test_164	Nope.  More fail.
eng_test_165	Typical liberal, left wing hatred from simple minded individuals who cannot accept or fathom reality.  Sucks to be you for the next four years.
eng_test_166	Impeachment? Don't be daft. He's fulfilling his mandate.
eng_test_167	Something similar happened when Bush was handed the Presidency by the Supreme Court. How did that work for ya? Oh. I forgot:  Everything Bush did is Obama's fault. Republicans: The Party of Who Me?
eng_test_168	Well...the video does show he lied about Wilson's speech at the FBI meeting.
eng_test_169	Neither President Obama (2016Jun09), nor "President" Trump (2017Feb24), nor "Attorney General" Sessions (2017Mar17) would answer the following questions to each of them about tobacco & alcohol:  Are there any scientific and/or medical purposes for the use of the psychotropic substances tobacco & alcohol? If there are, what are the scientific & medical purposes for the use of tobacco & alcohol?  What are the legitimate uses of the psychotropic substances, tobacco & alcohol, in this country?  What is(are) the reason(s) that tobacco & alcohol are exempt from the CSA [21 U.S.C. § 802(6)]?  Why haven't you called for Congress to either:  1) Repeal the exemptions of tobacco & alcohol from the CSA and classify tobacco as the schedule I controlled substance it is by definition, and alcohol as the schedule II controlled substance it is by definition;  or 2) Repeal the entire CSA and abolish the DEA?
eng_test_170	There has not been one sensible comment from any of the below. does Sunday  bring out all the stupids?   But it was nice to hear from a sensible person in the ambassador.
eng_test_171	So big and brave shooting an unarmed moose calf.   Next they'll be shooting itty bitty little pussy cats.  "That cat was going to attack!  I had no choice. It was him or me..."
eng_test_172	Not true!  You have to be able to use Sched A in lieu of the standard deduction to deduct taxes, I believe.
eng_test_173	Why should honouring the flag or the anthem be part of your duties as a professional athlete? Just play the game and let the flag wavers congregate on the town square on their own.
eng_test_174	You would not, would not, want to say that to my dad. Must I say to you again and again? You are an arrogant, ignorant, illiterate and and shallow non-human with an over-rated opinion of yourself that is embarrassing to all of us.
eng_test_175	Cuevas please tell us how or why you should be able to split your income with your stay at home spouse when other non-incorporated hard working Canadians cannot?   Let's start there and see if YOU even know what you are talking about.....your logic please sir?
eng_test_176	Anytime someone suggests doing something with someone elses money a red flag pops up in my wallet. As soon as Mr. Nordlund writes an article bragging how he personally put up his own salary, savings,  and pension to guarantee the loans he suggests need to be made I might be willing to listen.  Until then as long as this BS about someone else paying for another unsustainable "do-gooder" project continues I think I personally  prefer to listen to the red flag in my pocket as opposed to the insanities being spouted by some uninvested "investor. "
eng_test_177	You're right.....for us old guys 4 or 5 per wee would be pretty impressive.......regards, Gary
eng_test_178	Like getting pulled over for not having a broken taillight?
eng_test_179	Maybe thats whats happens when you legalize weed?
eng_test_180	He's an idiot for so many reasons.
eng_test_181	The dumbgooddoers of Europe let this horrible  trash into their countries. They deserve no better.
eng_test_182	Can't wait for American "anti-Trumpers" to emigrate to The Great White North.  They'll fit right in with the "Looney Left."  Here's looking at you, Canadian suckers.
eng_test_183	George was a fantastic individual.  I first met him in the early 90's.  He was the instructor for a graduate level accident investigation class I took.  He was a fantastic instructor.  Did you know he played tuba in the annual Anchorage Christmas concert?  I'd run into him, from time to time, and always enjoyed catching up.  Very sad day indeed.
eng_test_184	Right,  because the residents and neighborhood certainly won't benefit from infrastructure improvements,  would they?
eng_test_185	None of this happens outside.
eng_test_186	There's no grouping, clueless!!!  Check out the FACTS, which apparently don't fit your liberal views.  70% out of wedlock birth rate among young black females and to many of the males leaving them alone.  Black on black crime rate up double digits in Chicago in 2017 alone!!  And the lists go on and on.  I'm no where near as ignorant and arrogant as you sound!!!  Just so you know I was born into a military family and was going to the same schools, riding the same buses, walking the same streets, scout troops, sports and eating in the same lunch rooms as blacks, Hispanics and Asians.  And this was in the 50's & 60's, long before you ever saw the first minority.  And guess what clueless??  We  got along, because we "all" were held to the same standards expected of military personal/dependents living on base or in the surrounding areas.  Just a little personal knowledge and experience!!
eng_test_187	So, this clown was walking around in public with a loaded and cocked pistol on his person? He was, literally, an accident waiting to happen. Better he shot his stupid self than someone else.
eng_test_188	Make them pay for the $1.1M clean-up bill in North Dakota first.
eng_test_189	Nope. Sorry Boeing. Your jets are crap, we can't use them. Get lost.
eng_test_190	Collectively the Clinton campaign group have to be the dumbest group of people to ever use the internet.
eng_test_191	Make the promise, break the promise, double-down on why we really didn't break the promise, it just looks that way, but really we didn't, blame the previous PM, avoid answering the question in the house, send Justin on distraction tour....rinse and repeat with new broken promise.   The pattern with this government is as clear as Justin running one of the single most dishonest campaigns in Canadian history.
eng_test_192	Let's hope none of these new owners need to increase prices to get what they want for return on investment.  I moved out of my Eugene apartment a few years ago when they increased my rent by 12.5%; most fixed income folks can't afford to support organizations who increase basic housing that much.
eng_test_193	The BNC store is closed.
eng_test_194	Bob Rae started governing as the recession was starting but his policies sent the deficit through the roof.  The Alberta NDP are governing during a time of weak resource prices but their deficits are just going up and up even as resource prices are, at the very least, stabilizing and the rest of the Alberta economy recovers.  The B.C. NDP governed for a decade during a time when nearly every other Province was balancing their budgets but they just produced one deficit after another.  None of our parties have particularly "good" fiscal records, but the NDP certainly has NOT been the "best", especially if you look at any NDP other than the Saskatchewan NDP.  Even if you were to re-run the same calculation from the article you had linked, including the recent NDP deficits in Nova Scotia, Manitoba and Alberta, their record looks far worse then it did 6 years ago.
eng_test_195	They're probably thinking there's room to 5X the gas tax now that gas prices have dropped.
eng_test_196	You are right on the real story.  Hard to understand the blatant ignorance of publicly turning a blind eye to uranium sales, NSA spying on political rivals, secret meetings between AG's and former Presidents, Susan Rice, cash deliveries to Iran, 30,000 deleted e-mails under subpoena, destroyed devices, illegal FISA warrants, illegal "un-masking", and the outrageous act of not indicting a person that clearly violated the Secrets Act by James Comey.  Comparing all this to the "Russian" hacking(whatever that means) is obvious in it's sheer stupidity.
eng_test_197	Did none of you fools that strategically voted Trudeau a majority government not foresee this kind of incompetence happening?  Unbelievable.
eng_test_198	Gwen,  I, we, hear your frustration. We are all frustrated too. Event the homeless are frustrated for lack of REAL options they have available. That "resist going to the shelters" is propaganda, to get you, the average person, on the governments side in a game of "us against them."  There are not enough spaces in the shelters to fit everyone, as steeler says, there are 15,000 homeless a year. and roughly 5,000 bed spaces STATE wide. Do the math ! Name us someplace that a person getting $1,000 - $1,500 a month can live in Hawaii ? What kind of rentals are available for that ? Do they get to eat ? Or is that why the food bank fed 278,000 people last year ? Many seniors are on low incomes. Do we evict all of the senior citizens and force them to move to the mainland ? The DOE says there are 4,000 homeless children enrolled in school. Do we force all of those kids to move to foster homes on the mainland ?
eng_test_199	You must be a Communist China troll, guantanamo.
eng_test_200	What a disgusting state of affairs. It's just stupidity amplified.
eng_test_201	Very poor discretion used by the headline writer.
eng_test_202	If you have nothing to do or say, RW, please don't do it here. Hmmmm?
eng_test_203	you're getting goofy
eng_test_204	Someone needs to post the names of the legislators who vote against this in committee.
eng_test_205	Caldwell should have renamed HART the Daniel K Inouye Transit System.  Had he done so, every Democrat would have voted for it and he would have received an extra two or three billion to cover additional cost overruns.
eng_test_206	The OPP is "investigating"?  Why? What harm was done. Oh, someone told the truth in public about Kellie Leitch and the CPC.
eng_test_207	If you are expecting the DFI to limit its regulatory oversight to bitcoin payment processors, I'm afraid you may be misreading the situation. When Mt. Gox failed three years ago, the DFI issued the following warning:   "DFI licenses money transmitters in Hawaii and has not licensed any crypto-currency companies to do bitcoin exchanges, wallets or “mining” activity. If companies are offering to transmit bitcoins, they are doing so in violation of Hawaii’s money transmitter laws." (Source: http://cca.hawaii.gov/dfi/bitcoin-warning/)  To include mining activity and wallets (which could even include desktop software on a home computer) represents an expansive view of what constitutes money transmission. The law is written in such a way that it broadly defines money transmitters, with a few narrow exclusions, giving the department a lot of latitude to justify application of that law to nearly every aspect of crypto-currency use.
eng_test_208	Some of the best and brightest docs do a lot of research, for example clinical trials required for the development of medicines and devices. A member of the public who simply thinks "docs who earn more money are worse docs" might avoid those experts, instead of seeking them out.  As it happens, those docs are in very high demand, generally have long waiting lists, and will be happy not to see patients who see a negative correlation between income and quality.  Conversely, there are great docs who have no outside income, so a patient who thought "more income is better" might make the mistake of avoiding an excellent doc.  Trying to judge docs on the basis of their gross revenue from pharma and device work is about as dumb as trying to judge them on the basis of scores from anonymous social media like RateMDs, Yelp, etc.
eng_test_209	This amplifies everything that is wrong with Trudeau and Bombardier.   What an abomination.
eng_test_210	Just because his name was Smoke doesn't mean we need a SMOKESCREEN around his totally unnecessary death!  End the Iditarod and all other similar, stupid, pointless, cruel, greed/ego-driven dog races
eng_test_211	The Secret Service is working “to obtain permanent work space in an appropriate location” . May I suggest Ft. Leavenworth or the facility in Florence, Co.?  (Which raises an interesting question: When tRump is impeached and imprisoned, would the Secret Service be obligated to install agents in the prison?)
eng_test_212	All of them. I wish I were kidding, but that's the fact. All of them must die.
eng_test_213	Traitors? ?? Your crazy.  The president was clearly above the law.  He failed and continues to fail to enforce immigration law.  We have three EQUAL branches of government. The president is not a king. The traitors are the four that said he was.  The ends do not justify the means.  If you cannot get the.law you want you changes the legislators. You don't go around the law because YOU like the outcome.
eng_test_214	I guess he'd know, since he was the Senior White House speechwriter for that bastion of integrity, Richard Nixon.  Gee, I don't recall his idol, Tricky Dick, serving any time or in any substantive way being accountable for his blatant crimes.  Oh, he did "resign" the Presidency before he got kicked out.
eng_test_215	all that and throw in a top marginal tax rate approaching 54% , a harmonized sales tax of 13% and a growing $300 Billion debt............... - ouch
eng_test_216	But Republicans suck and he doesn't need them. At least that's what he's been saying.
eng_test_217	Bathrooms with stalls, coed, fine, whatever. Locker rooms, sorry I don't think people with penises should be on the benches around or in shower area with my wife and daughter. And the last poll I saw said something like 65 percent of the population agrees with me. Sorry if that offends the 1 woman in 200,000 with a penis who's affected or whatever the stat is. And I don't care how their groupies feel about it.
eng_test_218	weekends and public holidays are not part of working days.  Don't forget the 6 university credits that must be earned on the teacher's time and from the teacher's wallet to keep the teaching certificate renewed.. And all the nights and weekends grading and planning.  It's not 182 working days. And the work week is not limited to 40 hours.
eng_test_219	Sir, if its so bad in America, what the heck are you doing here? Put your big boy shoes on and go back to your own damn country. Stop saying bad things about mine. We are Alaskans and Americans. We may disagree, but we keep our noses out of other people's business.
eng_test_220	Eastern Canada screwed again by the Federal Liberals,Quebec,First Nations and tree huggers !! When will we ever learn? Atlantic Canada represented by all Liberal MP.s and they are too scared of their leader to say anythimg.
eng_test_221	Indeed, the amount of money that will be spent on accidents and medical bills etc. will make this "safety" issue expense look like peanuts. 1,000,000 a mile to pave roads? Gee, perhaps they could create a method in pave roads so they don't rut. Reinforced steel meshing?
eng_test_222	What the hell?? Is this article actually supposed to be funny?  Because it's stupid, stereotyping, and just plain mean!
eng_test_223	An idiot idea to address a non-existent problem. But the transit wizards have to do something to justify their fat paying, do-nothing jobs.   The bike lane on Broadway has already proven to be a stupid, virtually unused way to tie up a lane of traffic. I hardly ever see so much as one bicycle in that lane. Now the fools are going to take away the lane on the other side of the street.   I've already quit going into most of downtown Denver, now I guess I can cross south Broadway off my list of places to go to for entertainment. I wonder where the merchants are on this issue - they are the ones who are going to get hurt.
eng_test_224	Yes on 8
eng_test_225	Good one, thanks! I note that our non-DPP and whoever the non-hawk is are entirely silent.
eng_test_226	Luckily, you weren’t either.
eng_test_227	Trudeau Liberals = liars  Hackers are not the real threat, scumbag promise-breakers are.
eng_test_228	How is a soul black, racist?  Give it a rest, Wolf, as the racist and fascist labels do not apply unto them, but unto you.  I really want you to study the history of your own movement, beginning with your founder, Woodrow Wilson and his cohorts, really I do, because once you understand the truth of the matter, you, and many of your own ilk, will shut the hell up.
eng_test_229	Reminds me of the movie "Wag the Dog" where they convince everyone to tie ribbons to support bringing home POW "Good Ole' Shoe" (Woody Harrelson) from a fake war that doesn't exist...
eng_test_230	I agree completely with this letter. What disgusting fools to do this.
eng_test_231	Why is there no article about the Honolulu City Council working to declare Honolulu a sanctuary city?  If the idiots pull this off, I am definitely leaving the island for the mainland where common sense still lives.  Common sense is as dead as the Dodo bird here in Hawaii.  Want another example?  RAIL!!!

eng_test_236	Don, you're a hateful creature.
eng_test_237	Yep Jimmy, Trump hates children, the poor, the disadvantaged, the sick and the old.  He also wants dirty air and water.  What an interesting four years this will be.
eng_test_238	'some liberal groups have cited Drudge as a...'  you people have no shame. democrats will say anything. why do such piddling liars as you exist?
eng_test_239	What a mess. We have a fool at the helm of the Bank of Canada fueling this  asset bubble and  unwilling to raise rates for fear the whole house of cards will come tumbling down. We have  an Ontario government that is completely incompetent as well as corrupt that  has allowed this  problem to grow and fester.  The B.C. and federal governments have done nothing substantive to  help the situation.  I feel bad for anyone trying to buy a home in  the GTA or  in the Vancouver area. I really have no idea  how this will all play out but I fear it won't end well for some
eng_test_240	Given that climate has been changing for millions of years they would look as stupid as Trudeau and Obama if they failed to know about climate change 40 yeas ago.
eng_test_241	why would anyone in their right mind support the current administration's goals?  Trump is radioactive.....a Russian stooge.
eng_test_242	Classless hypocrite who could care less about 764 murders in Chicago this year.  As Trump says, "what do you have to lose"?  18 more days of the worst President of this generation
eng_test_243	Yah just delete them.
eng_test_244	Oh jesus. People like you are so annoying.
eng_test_245	BOOOOM!!!  What's that mate?  Oh that's just the daily Muslim terror attack think nothing of it.  KK, cherio sport.
eng_test_246	And we have been subsidizing Canadian media companies for years with some of the highest service rates in the developed world, along with CRTC protections. Not to mention helping out Bombardier, the auto sector, and Air Canada. If you had competitive products and prices, people would probably buy your services. Can't get one single break as tax payers, can we?
eng_test_247	Lefty hate-fest clown show.
eng_test_248	Jack Layton, Jack Layton.  You mean the Jack Layton that was caught in a whore house, that Jack Layton.
eng_test_249	Why doesn't Hales just stuff them all in cattle cars and ship them to "work camps" in the desert? Seems like that would make many people happy, judging by the level of vitriol against the homeless.
eng_test_250	Good riddance to a lousy marxist propaganda rag!
eng_test_251	Please.  Rural america provides some of our best and brightest and has since America's founding.    Rural public schools often provide a far superior education than their urban counterparts.  Remember the ITBS (Iowa Test of Basic Skills) tests from grade school?  Iowa has one of the best public school systems in the nation, same with Nebraska, Utah, Minnesota, etc.  The reason these kids have little chance to get into your Ivy League university is because you charge four times the amount of a state university.  The rural kids don't have those resources and are smart enough to stay away from the boondoggle you are running.
eng_test_252	Your a wimp  Grow a spine All muslims come from a religion with bad start  Get realistic about Islamic terrorist and understand that the leader of Islam is the descendent of an Egyptian slave and banished by Abraham  Mohammad committed a violent action on average every 6 week for the last 8 years of life Wonderful I'll take Jesus anytime
eng_test_253	If you do even the smallest amount of research you will find that the retail is going to include a grocery store ("Specialty grocer such as Whole Foods, Sprouts, or Natural Grocery).  Not to mention there is a grocery store set to open soon just southeast of here at Eastbridge.
eng_test_254	Your cranky racist story is BS. It outlines your hate and racism based violence (...tempted to spit in his face and call him a word you've never heard someone call anyone) and is worthy of a flag.
eng_test_255	I fought VA, LHIN, CCAC and their Quebec counterparts for a year to get my father a WWII veteran into the Perley and all I got was the run around.  VA and those other agencies are only concerned about self service and not those they are supposed to serve.  My father died before he could get into a veterans hospital.   VA should have their budget slashed, a new DM brought in from the outside and their disgusting red tape streamlined to serve clients not bureaucrats
eng_test_256	I can hardly wait till this all falls apart. I will make millions buying for pennies on the dollar. Mulrooney told you in the 80's get out of and stay out of debt. Then the liebrals set you up with cheap rates and stupid you walked in. Me, I made sure Inever went into debt and saved. Thanks idiots, I'm happy.
eng_test_257	So you are in favor of higher costs. That means you go shopping for a tv and seek out the highest priced one and get it. Thats exactly the same analogy as being excited about paying higher taxes.
eng_test_258	wasn't her time taken away last time she did this??
eng_test_259	Bubble Guts and Motley, you only mock your own triviality. Hundreds of people died to achieve the 40-hour week, end child labor, and win a living wage. Apparently those things are worthy of mockery to you two fools.
eng_test_260	You are truly demented in your love of Trump...
eng_test_261	Baird knew they were "lavs".
eng_test_262	Springfield has had a long line of pro economy Mayor's and staying to a Springfield plan.  Lundberg keeps moving Springfield forward as did Lively, Morrisette and Leiken.  The difference between Eugene and Springfield's leadership is stark.
eng_test_263	This new Canada is getting sick and disgusting.  What's next, assisted murder for simple convenience?  This is an entirely rhetorical question, as liberal insanity knows no bounds. I guaran-damn-tee unless we get back to our true Christian values, it will truly be the inmates running the asylum, even moreso than it already is.  They're just getting warmed up.

eng_test_264	After costs of foreclosure and sale, the housing market has to fall 30% before the lender takes a loss.  It is possible to not have a credit record if you are a recent immigrant. You could have a stable job and some money, but are too new to establish a record.
eng_test_265	Now how will this spin as good news I wonder? "Canada-China partnership" or some sort of pyrrhic victory? The timing is interesting considering the sale of ITF and Norsat. The quote of "China has switched to favouring using the “front door” to obtain sophisticated technology from the West. Instead of “backdoor” computer hacking" tells you everything you need to know. If we had tech the Chinese wanted then they were either going to hack to get it, or buy it outright. Our government caved and decided to cut their losses and sell it to them for the lack of foresight of protecting Canadian IP (which has been a constantly ignored issue since the Chretien days). Unfortunately this was understood a long time ago. Even comments on this board have alluded to this or stated such outright.
eng_test_266	Well, this will not endear our dear leader to US Republicans or Democrats.  Without a full national security review, this sale should not go forward..  Mr Trudeau and gang of socialist schemers, do the right thing.

So does Craig replace the last Senate PR flack who was driving drunk, and hit a couple of people, or does he replace the flack that was arrested for choking his girlfriend?

eng_test_310	Oh, bullshit.  You need to grow up.  Trump and the GOP are the ones that created the problem; they are the ones that need to fix it. Enabling their behavior as you do does nothing constructive to resolve the problem: It just makes it worse. This isn't high school; in real life the bully who ignores the rules and assaults someone is the one deemed responsible.  You don't say "good job"; you make them go back and start over or face the consequences.  In this case starting over means honoring the nomination and confirmation process by doing things right and following the rules, starting with nominating Merrick Garland.

eng_test_317	How is this ridiculous? Perhaps if those 86 fools in France would have just gotten out of the way, there would have been no reason to shoot the driver. A few years ago,  where I live, in the Austin area, a driver in an SUV purposely plowed into a supermarket and killed 1 customer and crippled the niece of a friend of mine who just didn't manage to make the choice to get out of the way.  Off the top of my head, I can think of another time someone drove their vehicle into a Luby's restaurant in Temple, TX and 23 people were just too stupid to get out of the way of the vehicle and the driver's bullets. It's a miracle that no one died in this incident, and it would have been wise for anyone with a clear shot to assume this was a terrorist and remove the threat.
eng_test_318	Yeah that's real smart, show up on private property & threaten a stranger. Sounds like a good way to get shot.
eng_test_319	What an absolute disgrace for any school to deny entry based on another country's position, vis a vis 'Israel's right to exist'.

They probably cannot even point to Israel on the map.
eng_test_320	As a card carrying libertarian, I find this initiative appalling. Any regressive democrat with a preschool level understanding of economics would know that artificially limiting growth in the housing market will only drive housing costs higher, further driving out the poor by making it more unaffordable to live in Colorado. It's called supply and demand. If the supply of a highly demanded product goes down, the cost for that product goes up, especially if that demand is artificially limited.  All the policies that have been passed in the last 20 years by so-called progressives have created the perfect storm in the Colorado housing crisis we have today: increased property taxes, inordinately high and unnecessary construction standards which drive up insurance costs for developers, and now artificially capping growth. If anything, this initiative is an attack on the poor. Funny how democrats attempts to help are actually making the housing situation worse for those on the bottom.
eng_test_321	Did you read the previous article before you passed judgement? "Investigators were unable to collect physical or witness evidence suggesting the trailer had "functioning" smoke detectors, Tyler said. But they continue to look for remnants of detectors." "It is possible they're there," Tyler said." Fifty years ago my mother's brand new trailer house that we were not living it yet but had put all of our belongings in, caught fire within a few hours of the gas company hooking up the gas.  It exploded into flames and was totally consumed within a mater of seconds. The very thick and toxic smoke was so bad you couldn't see the trailer and the smell of buring insulation, carpet, plastic, tile, and plastic pipes made people close by vomit and burned our eyes. The intense heat caused all the lighting to melt, even the appliances melted.  Legally, the landlords ARE responsible for installing smoke alarms at the time of lease and if it's a month to month rental, then landlords are responsible.

eng_test_334	My father was American Indian who was born and raised on a reservation in New Mexico. He entered the Army and was sent to the Aleutians Islands during the war. When he came home he talked often about the war there and conditions on the islands. Mostly about there being no trees and how the wind seemed to drive some of the men mad. But what I remembered most and never forgot, was him telling me about what happened to the Aleut people. He use to tell us that they were like us but they had been sent away to "camps" like what they had done to the Japanese people he had gone to high school with, who went to camps, loosing their homes and the carrot and lettuce fields they had owned.  I think he told us this because he wanted us to know and be aware it could happen to us too. I think he told us because he wanted us to remember because few people outside the Aleuts and Army knew about what had been done to them.  He told us about the Navajo code talkers before knowledge of them was public.

eng_test_340	Salaried firefighters don't work for the plain and simple reason that you don't have the option to send someone home when their hours are maxed out. If a spot is open on a truck, it has to be filled or the response coverage for that district is compromised. For guys that are already working a 56 hour week if you tack another 24 hour shift onto that.....they can't expect to work that for nothing.   AFD is understaffed, just like most of our city services. However better management of the leave, specifically a renegotiation to the leave policy in the union contract to limit how many of each position in the department can request projected leave at once, seems to be a reasonable solution. Projected time off should not generate overtime, and both sides of union negotiations should be on board with that. The overtime hours paid has been an annually repeating black eye for AFD, it's time to fix it.

eng_test_349	Not according to the Washington Post survey about police killings. They are actually down a bit from 2015. Police do not commit murder, they kill someone in the line of duty, self defense or in very rare cases, shoot someone unlawfully, which could be called murder, more accurately manslaughter. That occurrence is very rare.

eng_test_368	I foresee a lot of fake rental agreements signed between friends, with no follow up by city authorities to verify that a "renter" is actually living in the home, and no collaboration with federal tax authorities to verify that rent is actually being paid.  Someone could take out a mortgage and report rental income that is not actually being paid equal to the mortgage interest; the effect would be zero profit and thus no income tax, and no vacancy tax on what is actually a vacant property. But with the administrative costs paid for by honest people who do pay taxes.  A bonus from this predictable scheme is that people trying to prove residency in Canada for purpose of obtaining citizenship will now have a large pool of owners of vacant homes wanting to enter into fake rental agreements that benefits both parties. I predict immigration lawyers building a business around this opportunity.

eng_test_375	Perhaps if Canadian advertisers weren't so lazy and actually spent some time and effort to create memorable TV ads to air during Super Bowl, there wouldn't be such pressure from viewers to have the government overrule the ad substitution practice that has been prevalent. Instead, all we in Canada see during the Super Bowl are the run-of-the-mill ads that advertisers have already been running for months. Memo to advertisers and TV stations: when we see your 'vanilla' ads, we use the time to visit the bathroom or go to the fridge. You gain nothing.
eng_test_376	Nope....they're FCS.  Big Sky Conference football teams participate in the FCS playoffs, not the FBS bowls.  FBS and FCS schools are all NCAA Division I for the other sports (the Big Sky basketball tournament champion does, for instance, go to the NCAA Division I Tournament...usually as a #13-#16 seed).  In football, Eastern Washington, North Dakota, Cal Poly, and Weber State represented the Big Sky in the 2016 FCS Playoffs, with Eastern Washington losing to Youngstown State in the semifinals.  Scholarships numbers are the difference. NCAA FBS- 85 max. NCAA FCS- 65 max. NCAA Division II- Equivalent of up to 36 (can be partials between more than one athlete, for total up to 36). NCAA Division III- No athletic scholarships.

eng_test_387	You have hit on a characteristic that is common with narcissists and it is related to my comment regarding an authentic self; they have no originality.  They mimic, mirror, and emulate others, adopting beliefs, activities and values of those they target, and they are dumbfoundingly skilled at it.  Their acting abilities are beyond what most people can understand, possibly because in the moment they believe themselves. One victim stated that they fake emotions better than ordinary people feel the real thing. It is regularly seen in abused spouses who have difficulty leaving their abuser.   The abuser turns on the charm, promises, goes on best behavior, woos, "love bombs," and ordinary people cannot believe that anyone who didn't really feel that way could possibly exert so much effort to lie.  Trump's voters are going to have difficulty believing they have been conned as much as they have, but they will.  Disillusionment is the only possible outcome to this disaster.

eng_test_399	I know they told you that you had to have a four year college education to get a 'real' job, but learning a trade will always be valuable and make more money than most four year degress. Welders, commercial divers, tool pushers, electricians, pipe fitters, union workers, and such maybe looked down by liberals as uneducated, but will continue to make six figures.

eng_test_403	The lack of compassion expressed here by so many - I would say it is alarming, but it isn't. It's so commonplace now that its shock value no longer registers.  Yes, she is here unlawfully (and no, it is not illegally, the difference due to that violation being civil in nature, not criminal, but we won't let facts and things like that get in the way of the blood lust here). Yes, she committed a crime (related to identity theft, which for what it's worth, wasn't a crime until 1998).  One term that hasn't been used in a while, or, allowed, is that big heavy thing that holds a ship in place, rhymes with rancor, plus baby. Those children are US citizens. In so many other aspects of family law and elsewhere, the overriding trump card of justifying whatever is "the best interest of the child." The one major exception to this precept is immigration law. In this area of the law, the best interest of a child apparently carries zero weight.

eng_test_408	You're right: The Republicans -- especially McConnell and Ryan -- regard Trump as a "useful idiot" who will sign whatever they put on his desk. Trump is proving that their confidence is well placed as he pushes a healthcare bill that breaks every commitment he made about healthcare during the campaign and the transition. However, neither McConnell nor Ryan makes much effort to disguise their contempt for Trump, even as they (Ryan especially) fawn over him to get the healthcare farce passed. It is not hard to see that at some point, Trump will no longer be useful to them; he'll merely be an idiot. They'll turn on him in a New York minute and gleefully embrace President Pence. Trump's incompetence, corruption and lunacy are not sustainable. I think American politics have already rendered Trump no longer useful to Putin; to him, Trump is no loner useful; he's merely an idiot -- except to the extent that Trump's presidency is destabilizing both domestically and on the world's stage.

eng_test_410	One tax break down and how many more personal as well as corporate tax breaks to go?  This is one small step for out of control spending and one giant leap for the tax payer.  Just say "no" to more new taxes and fees, the ocean of debt will become clearer and clearer and we will begin to drain the swamp.  Eventually, the political class will have no where to run and nobody to hide behind.  Leadership is hard, make them sweat with transparency and simplicity.  Design a tax system that "even a caveman can understand."

eng_test_415	The total losses referred to in this article amount to less than 1% of the total amount of money invested in this industry.  What about the other 99% of the capital?  Why did these journalists not take into consideration any of the well run MICs in Canada?   My math directly from the article (includes only the MICs):  Losses due to Bad Management: $33.5 Million (Trimor, Infuse, Atlantic Tides, Optam, Prime West) Losses due to Fraud/Ponzi: $150 Million (Base Finance) Total Amount Invested According to Article:  $25 Billion  Even if you include the non MICs - Titan ($30 Million in syndicated mortgages) and Omni Arch ($100 Million US  Mortgages) it still only equate to 1.2% of the total industry.    In my opinion, a horribly unbalanced article.

eng_test_421	Reading the article again, it just says it was for "minor children," and makes no mention of their relationship to Katherine (if there was one at all).  But it seems like it it could only be kept quiet for this long if it was within the family... You can bet I'd be raising hell with the police/bar association/press if my lawyer stole $150,000 from my kids' trust fund.
eng_test_422	I totally agree.   One additional problem with Obama's recognition plan: there had never been a racially-defined polity in Hawaii. Citizenship was determined by many criteria but was most contingent on birth in Hawaii, and ability to contribute to Hawaii's multi-cultural, meritocratic society. The law in question is the absolute opposite of how things worked in the Kingdom of Hawaii.

eng_test_425	The embodiement of Tulsi Gabbard  is kept very secretive from media  Only if you are one of the clan of 200 disciples and followers, who live right in Kailua next to the million dollar beachfront abodes of their Lanikai Cult leader, (Hare Krsna) birth name- Chris Butler, would you be privy to the inner workings of the cult leader and his hold on the Gabbard’s. All sign anti-disclosure documents so you won’t be hearing from any of them too soon. Ex- cult members and children who left after they realized their guru was a fraud may be the source to get some truth.  Butler through his network of devoted brainwashed followers have manipulated social media to bolster support for Gabbard. Brainwashed Tulsi is not ignorant of her actions, she hides behind her mask of deceit well, but one day the veil of her hypocrisy will be removed, but not until she chooses to divorce herself from the meddling claws of her guru who directs her every move both political and personal.
eng_test_426	“The Republicans engaged in historic obstructionism that made it possible for this confirmation process to be conducted,” said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. “We now have a radical right-wing justice on the Supreme Court.   Gorsuch is expected to join a conservative-leaning voting bloc of justices, making five on the nine-member court.  The above quotes are amazing in that the same old misinformation continues to be pushed. Judge Gorsuch isn't a "radical right-wing justice" by anyone's measure except someone who has a radical left-wing view. He has shown in the past to be very much like the justice he is replacing. And the "conservative-leaning voting bloc of justices" have "allowed" a fair number of liberal rulings, so it isn't that this changes the "tilt" of the court. The next appointment, however, could bring a dramatic shift.   And although unsaid, this article hints at the fact that when McConnell made his decision to let the next president select, it looked like it would be Hillary.
eng_test_427	How many years I've been watching this market?  Going on ten now.  The smart money was getting into it then, just as they have been getting out some time now.  Government support will only last so long, they just don't want to be blamed for the outcome.
eng_test_428	To add to the "kit housing" complaints: The boring one fits all look of developer housing is beginning to define a new Portland aesthetic - blandly depressing. There is no archecture involved. Of course the rational is cost. Not true. Housing does not make people. People do. Our city of Portland should step in to  make low rent housing more of a joy for tenants to come home to. Leave the trees, use colors, mix up the styles, imploy fun and unpredictable elements.
eng_test_429	Your comment is interesting in that your "quotes" are similar to what you would get from the abused, vbictimized and brutalized just about anywhere - confusion, reaction, loss and everything else that goes with hundreds of years of injustice.

eng_test_430	Measurement in the health care system is a double edged sword. On one side the information that results can help make better decisions. However, healthcare is laden with subjective human experience and intangibles which massively impact the data in unpredictable ways and can severely damage its value. Secondly, the collection of data is a labour intensive process, one which I suspect accounts for a significant portion of the 28.3% of the hospital budget. More data is not the answer, carefully measuring the correct information in a controlled environment is.  If I was setting up a measurement system, I would restrict most data measurement to specific study hospitals that were designed to be research intensive. The vast majority of hospitals do have neither the personnel or resources to do that now, meaning most of the data collected from them is often meaningless.

Fact is when people get more life experience, grow up and  don't depend on other peoples money they tend to become conservatives. Sadly the left tries to disrupt the meetings of conservatives especially at universities. And sadly the leftists love to work in the media industry and at teaching jobs and thus dominate it.

If we lost ... as we probably probably would have done (with this current Supreme Court) ... no big deal.  The nation (and our hapless government) could have all (honestly) shrugged their/our collective shoulders and said, "It's the court's decision."   And lawyers have to eat too.  The extra $10,000,000.00 that Mr. K would have been awarded in a court decision is chump-change to Prime Minister Trudeau. His people will just borrow it from China, and your kids or grandkids will pay it back someday. With interest, obviously ...  Thank goodness for small mercies (mercys?) that the interest-rate isn't too high these days. :)

I say kill them all. I like this guy too. I wanted to kill the pervert that hurt my child but as a parent I needed to be here to help my daughter get the help she needed. Don't think killing him didn't cross my whole families mind. Screw them stop keeping them in jail and use that money to help the innocent children that are being hurt. Hell cut there hand and penis off and then they can't hurt anyone no more. Give me the knife I'll do it.
eng_test_494	Your responses insult those who disagree with you, rather than discuss the issue.  You can do better.  So let's drop the mutual one-upmanship.    You seem to hold Harbaugh in high esteem. JH has displayed many faults, evident to any who choose to dig below the headlines.  And stating that WT "cares not a whit of what those outside his orbit think of him", actually presumes that he does care what those within his orbit think of him.  Obviously those within his orbit include opposing coaches. and you're right, they don't give this a second thought.  They understand why he had Alie throw the late pass, and don't whine about it.  That's crybaby stuff and beneath them.  WT has spoken quite well to a positive code of ethics from dismissing  Darren Carrington as well as a coach that set a poor example, to creating a positive environment with small group sensitivity awareness sessions for his athletes.  I find much positive evidence in his character and support him.    I'm out.

eng_test_497	Usage-based taxes, or general taxes?  Because that's the key distinction here, whether roads should be funded by any usage-based taxes/fees or not (like the gas tax and auto registration fees).    And if you say Yes to some of the funding coming from usage-based taxes/fees, then it's only fair that BOTH users of roads (motor vehicles AND bikes) pay a fair usage-based tax.  And if not, then we should just switch 100% to general funding for roads (like your public school example).

eng_test_508	Censorship is used to silence dissenting views.  All comments are closed, which means ADN is not subversively promoting those with a different opinion than you.    Many online news outlets occasionally close comments (or just don't open them) when the content is likely to devolve into racial or bigoted hysterics.  I've even seen it many times on Fox News, of all places, where many comment threads include KKK level nonsense.  Yet some stories elicit threads too vile even for them.  ADN is making an effort to improve the civility of the conversation.  The problem is, some stories elicit a high degree of incivility from otherwise civil citizens.  ADN is taking the easy way out here, but I don't really blame them.  They don't have the staff or inclination to moderate these topics, so they very occasionally take a pass.

But in the state like Hawaii it's an important deduction for the middle class as well.   Payroll taxes. We should deduct all of it and not just a portion.   And I would start paying taxes at the minimum wage rate rather than at $15,000. More like over $20,000 a year.
eng_test_515	It just goes to show how ignorant people in the sound transit zone are.
eng_test_516	I Wikipedia Harriet Tubman.  I'm OK with it, works for me.  I hope everybody Wikipedia her,  she has an incredible history.
eng_test_517	Well, but that is ignoring the fact that many people are moving here from California.   There are lots of folks selling their homes in California and coming to Oregon.   And they end up having way more than enough money to simply buy a house outright here.   No need at all to get any mortgage.  That is what is driving the prices up so very high.   All of these wealthy purchasers coming from out of state.
eng_test_518	Damn shame the bear was killed.  Are there no provisions for tranquilizing the bear and re-locating it?
eng_test_519	It sickens me that my tax dollars helped pay the salary of scum like this.  Life in prison w/o parole would be nice.
eng_test_520	If one was incapable of comprehending this type of debate as you clearly are, I can see how dumb religious bigots would draw your conclusion.
eng_test_521	Of course he can have an opinion & express it. However, his choice to do it on his employer's time & irritate paying customers was a foolish one. His fate of unemployment was predictable as it would be if you or I had decided to make political statements at work & irritate paying customers. The NFL being what it is, he may have gotten some leeway had he played at the star level he has in the past. He didn't.  Showing up for work with his "cops as pigs" socks was also poor judgment even though Constitutionally protected expression.  No one is stopping him, or stopped him last year, from exercising his rights. No one put him in jail. But he's not protected from the consequences of bold statements that his employer perceives as damaging to business. He could have been released based on performance, & other teams may find his performance of his job inadequate.  BTW, he IS one of the rich you disdain. He has been well compensated for both good & mediocre performance of his job.

eng_test_524	Gary, you have found your cause.  You have identified issues that are important to you and the planet and are speaking out and seeking change.  Social, political, financial, and demographics factors are a the top of the list of impediments to long term solutions.  You see the problems as inequality, power and money.  You have earned you seat along with Frank on Dr. Chip's smart list.  Get your message out.  Turn the heat up and the global warming engine off.  Best regards.
eng_test_525	Dumb. What's next? Fines for murder or sexual assault.    Break the law by killing someone while driving carelessly, treat it as manslaughter and throw them in jail. Simple.  An Ordinary Canadian can't pay $50,000 to get out of jail, but rich kids like Justin or Muzzo can easily squeeze 50 large out of their "family fortune".  Where's the equity, the fairness, in any of that?    Another 'make-the-rich' Liberal party vote getting ploy?  Talk about pandering to the minority.  Sickening.
eng_test_526	He has a 6th amendment right to confront his accuser, and you can't cross-examine a written statement. If you want to blame someone, blame the Rules of Evidence, not the District Attorney who understands and follows them.
eng_test_527	What a horrible leader the Republicans have elected ... embarrassing.
eng_test_528	This is as stupid as the 50 times the Republicans votes to repeal Obamacare.
eng_test_529	I don't think anyone sees Trump as being perfect! He is not a disillusioned sneak like Obummer, wanting to change America into some preconceived idea that his race baiting socialist brain has contrived. The charges against Trump are suspicious at best, likely outright lies by women being bought by the Democrats crooked election machine. The idea that Trump is loud, outspoken, able to make a buck and doesn't cower down to the hard RIGHT makes him someone I will support - RATHER than a career criminal that has made it her life work to make herself 'rich & famous' Her lack of concern for Gays and Women in the countries she has accepted MILLIONS OF DOLLARS from should make women and Gays in America SICK!! She is a disgusting individual, likely very sick in the head.

eng_test_532	Thank God for this article. I was just thinking the other day how miserable all those poor realtors must feel having to deal with massive commissions for doing next to no work in a bloated and overpriced market. Boo freakin' hoo.  I am getting bombarded by calls, e-mails and regular mail from realtors all but BEGGING me to sell my house. If they're conflicted over that behaviour, I'm not seeing it.
eng_test_533	I am waiting to read how this kind of game is what is wrong with the world. You complainers are coming with it, so I thought I would get out ahead of it and acknowledge you before you get here.
eng_test_534	"Perhaps they appreciate the toll it takes on one’s psyche having to pay close attention to all that dreadful droning and then translating it into something resembling comprehensible English.

eng_test_537	Is there a silver lining within the DPRK claim to having achieved their long sought inter continental ballistic missile IOC?  Maybe so.   We currently have a LOT of technical assets in the ROK south of the 38th parallel (e.g. the long range AN/TPY 2 radar that feeds THAAD). Ergo we are in an excellent position to do some valuable research including the harvesting of [1] GPS launch site coordinates in the  DPRK and [2] some vital sigint signature data emitted during that most valuable (vulnerable) part of their ICBM flight regime, the launch/climb out phase BEFORE the bird goes exo-atmospheric. By applying these data we can sharpen and refine our missile intercept capability ashore, aboard ship and in low earth orbit to the point where we might well be able to destroy these SNDV blooms soon after launch instead of trying to pick them off in space or even worse in the brief terminal phase after warhead re-entry on its way to the desired ground zero on our homeland. Let's be optimistic.
eng_test_538	All politicians are liars and cheaters. When they are not kissing babies they are stealing their lollipops.
eng_test_539	Have these clowns in Canadian government ever had a original thought since the first tax increase.  That is all every single one of them knows, tax and spend.  To think these same people hate Trump.  Voters are such fools.
eng_test_540	Because everyone retracted it wrt Clinton.  Otoh, none have done so on trump. Why did you KNOWINGLY elect a rapist?
eng_test_541	Good plan ........ Because Trump is proving to be useless
eng_test_542	So let me get this straight, when foreign money comes in and buys real estate in Vancouver and Toronto we have to create laws to control and discourage them. Then a few weeks later we announce a plan that would see us try to attract foreign investment, in our roads bridge and airports. To recap, we should control foreign ownership of residential real estate, but we want to sell them our roads , bridges, airports and anything else we can think of. I can only surmise that this is government's attempt at humour.
eng_test_543	Over $200k total in damages in a year from separate incidents.  It's time for some security...cameras...anything!   In the meantime, I'm placing another call to karma.

eng_test_545	They only catch the dumb ones.
eng_test_546	People are not perfect and politicians less so. Why would anyone expect to agree 100% with anyone else's political view. Life and politics are not perfect and it is our obligation to choose that which we feel is best. Advocating apathy (not voting) because something doesn't go our way is shirking our responsibility as citizens and is IMO reckless.
eng_test_547	Partially because he is simply a useful idiot to some with specific financial and social control agendas. Also because many in this nation would salute a bag of cement if you if stencil an "R" or a "D" on it.

eng_test_549	Can we say that these white men are lazier than most because profs don't do much except repeat the same thing to every class they "teach" year in and year out?  Could we say that people like Herron want her race to get more of the "do nothing prof jobs" because they are also lazy?    Who knows what her objective was to post that on a blog.  All I Or most can see is that she is a racist screaming for more blacks in lazy prof positions.
eng_test_550	Using anyone's' children in a comment is a cheap shot violation and may result in very unfavorable consequences. That's putting it nicely, perverted creep.

eng_test_556	Trump is so dumb! HAHAHAHAHAHA!
eng_test_557	Silly rabbit.   That's not where it starts in most cases like this. It starts with an individual breaking the law. Then police are called. It then proceeds to said individual threatening police after they engage him/her. From there it follows basic police procedure.  It's simple really.   Hundreds of people interact with police officers on a daily basis and make good decisions and wake up the next morning. A few don't.
eng_test_558	Is this guy a paranoid, narcissistic sociopath?...or just a nut?  Does being really really rich make it all OK?
eng_test_559	Do you tell whites to stop killing other whites?  Because that's who kills white folks.  If not, why not?
eng_test_560	You comment proves what a Kangaroo Court any trial by the Trump administration would be.
eng_test_561	I find it instructive that when the Liberals started negotiating with individual provinces there was no hew and cry about "divisive politics". If the Conservatives had done this we would of had to put up with weeks of media hysteria  about how the "divisive politics" of Harper's Conservatives are destroying the country.

eng_test_567	You are going to get FAR more money from a bank than a gun store and at much lower risk.    Assuming they get 10 guns each on average and assuming they get the higher end pistols mid range rifles the average value retail of that haul is maybe 8 grand.   Now hot weapons sell for much less than retail unless there is something rare about it in a stolen weapon that makes it valuable so the robbers may clear 1-2 grand IF they are lucky on the smash and grabs.   A bank robbery without any access to the safe will net you that.   Hell gas station and fast food places will net you that.   And yes your original post was completely asinine and deserved to be called out as such.   Claiming something is unsecured because someone was able to steal it is stupid beyond belief.
eng_test_568	If he's a leading republican then maybe he should focus on freeing us of the worse healthcare law ever and conducting a complete reform of our bad joke of a tax code.
eng_test_569	You'd "like to trust" that people aren't scared, stupid, and fearful.   I, however, would also like to trust that, but I know better. Given the opportunity, evangelicals WILL impose their misguided and fearful beliefs on anyone they can.
eng_test_570	Boots, Peter,  why do you make these blanket assertions that republicans do not care for the poor or middle class? Are you so arrogant and narcissistic as to think that you have all the answers? Keep an open mind.
eng_test_571	He's a buffoon and a liar.
eng_test_572	Immigration is not a zero sum game, and I have seen too much research that shows immigrants, on the whole, bring and start new business. As for our habitable geography I respectfully submit that you are quite incorrect. For example, I drove from Edmonton to Whitehorse recently and there are people living all along that route, remote though it sometimes is.
eng_test_573	In all seriousness, what is the difference with white people having a rally for their race versus all of the rallies we've seen for blacks and hispanics?  They are all xenocentric.
eng_test_574	I'm sure if the schools were not publicly funded and "liberal" as you call them, you would still complain if an effort was being made to curb people's hate and bullying, right? Because if only a few are targets, that's ok.  Calling it out reminds you of the uncomfortable fact that you yourself are deficient when it comes to empathy. Better to come off like a hard ass and spread baseless BS in your defense. Just another ignorant, racist troll. Maybe some interracial underwater basket weaving classes are just what you need.
eng_test_575	You need to grow up and be honest. The real detailed financials that should be illuminated are for the Clintons..."We're destitute..." before Hillbag became SecSt then with the Clinton Foundation "pay for play" from foreign nationals(which is Treason) she and Chelsea are now worth 150M$+ !!
eng_test_576	The end of another anti-human tale generating worldwide headlines to serve the political/religious wants of the CONservative/christian demand that all living things be kept alive with every mechanical device created by human hands for as long as possible.  The suffering of the individual matters not as the great press benefits for the totalitarian religious dictators supercedes any human pain.  A child suffering a devastating condition used as a poster child for religious dogma certification feeding on the emotional dysfunction of parents blind to the child's needs over their own sense of loss and guilt.  The disgusting displays by politicians and religious "leaders(not)" led by a Pope denying all human access to contraception, sex education, and end of life choices stirring the insanity of a brainwashed populace.  Corporate Media feed at the same trough of pain and suffering to generate ad revenue from readership expansion.  All guilty of human degradation to serve selfish wants.  Sad

eng_test_587	When one looks at consumer law in Canada, in all jurisdictions, they are woefully lacking in one thing. The laws do not protect the consumer.

If you're evidence of our law enforcement and you don't know the difference between getting your ID from your pocket vs the firearm that is located in the car but not on your person than you have severe issues my friend.    You inform the officer that there is a firearm in the car because by law you must do so, but happen to be getting your id as instructed then the officer says put your hands up and shoots before finishing the sentence? This evidenced by a nurse who witnessed the entire encounter than you have no business being in law enforcement since you don't have common damn sense and the ability to harness your emotions.  At least finish your sentence before shooting the person center mass fool!

It could be faked but that would help I would think.  It would also make sense to have a registry. Those are really simple things that would help the problem a great deal.  It wouldn't solve it, youre always going to have dishonest people. But it would make a hope for them to have to jump through.
eng_test_600	The jury screwed up. Once Zimmerman charged Martin after being dropped, Zimmerman should have stayed down. Young black men are treated like enemy combatants by police and vigilantes rather than as someone in their custodial care. It is the police state mentality that needs changing and not just where black people are concerned. When the general will is not present, legislating morality results in police state action. It's a bad idea.
eng_test_601	The paucity of comments on this entire topic shows the general public's interest in this matter.  I have a feeling that whatever caused the Admiral's removal will never really be known as it mostly likely is  not a matter of national security as much as  a political misstep.

I then ask, wouldn't you prefer to go out and make a better life for you and your family, and the answer is "no" it's too difficult to make it and you gotta work too hard. So I'm just going to work the minimum or not all because I don't want to lose my benefits. It's a vicious cycle and way too easy to stay on it! There are no incentives to get off medicaid and welfare.

The larger issue is the number of casual and self-serving lies in this administration.  Is it to be a contest for who can lie the most and get away with it?

eng_test_632	The way I understand this is that it is the frequency penetration of the electromagnetic radiation aka RF radiation that could possibly be harmful to humans and health -  so the longer the wave the less penetrating to the body, the shorter and quicker the wave like microwave radiation the more penetrable to the body which consist mostly of fluid. I've also noticed that the majority of wireless industry people or supported by telecommunication industry are all promoting RF radiation and 'relying' (making money) from outdated 1998 ICNIRP safety guidelines also a crux for our  SA Department of 'Health'.  "The exposure guideline used by many agencies was established in 1998 by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and was based only on established short-term thermal (heating) effects from RF radiation neglecting non-thermal biological effects." (Dr Lennart Hardell, WHO, radio frequency radiation and health - a hard nut to crack).
eng_test_633	I love how this administration is filled with people who don't understand even the basics of governing. You don't care if you get sued? There goes any profits you were thinking about. As they won't be realized until after you are out of office. How stupid can these people be?
eng_test_634	I'm not Scottie :)
eng_test_635	Oh please! Chump calls him a "bad governor" and a "bad host of the Apprentice" and you take Chumps side as a bully??? That's the sick part of this. People think this clown is the savior. The only thing he's saving is his wealth and the wealth of his buddies....AKA Putin!
eng_test_636	Thanks for condensing your message. I suggest you shorten all your comments likewise.
eng_test_637	Self cleaning as stated below....
eng_test_638	hahaha, Singapore doesn't tax capital gains, Wall St. including GoldmanSachs fired many US employees and opened up in Singapore to bypass stupid taxation. Careful, the world has opened tax havens and corporations and the elite have started to shuffle their money and citizenship's around. There is such a thing as STUPID government, and Hawaii is #1 on the stupid list. LOL  http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-is-firing-employees-in-the-us-so-it-can-hire-1000-in-singapore-2011-6

eng_test_642	Darn, what a loss

eng_test_645	How is Hazel Dell "Suburban Portland"? Isn't it just Hazel Dell?
eng_test_646	It's not a labor shortage, it's pure government lies. Job vacancy is at 2%. Unemployment is 7% and underemployment is 14%, so 21% of Canadian employees are not getting their needs met. That means employers are getting their needs met 21:2, or more than 1000% more than Canadians! The job market is broken because of too much immigration and foreign workers. The number one thing we 100% have to do to fix the economy is REDUCE LABOR SUPPLY! Even Yellen knows this http://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-yellen-sees-some-possible-benefits-from-running-economy-with-tight-labor-market-2016-10-14

eng_test_648	It look like the 17-year-old got the better of the 26-year-old. I don't imagine the threatened officer is worrying too much about this loser.
eng_test_649	The Washington Post was well known during the American election for its fact checking of Donald Trump' s statements. However, it also gave its vaunted four Pinnochios award to the anti-Keystone ads of  Democratic fund raiser, Mr Tom Steyer, and also gave its four Pinnochios award to President Obama for repeating its claims. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/03/02/obamas-claim-that-keystone-xl-oil-bypasses-the-u-s-earns-four-pinocchios/) https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/31/an-over-the-top-ad-attacking-the-keystone-xl-pipeline/).
eng_test_650	Back to the subject of this column: First, there were about 48 million without ins before O'Care and 29 million without after O'Care. In 2015, US life expectancy dropped for the first time in 20 years. There has also been in incease in doctor errors re: txt of pt's.  Second, the wealthy and all middle income Americans will benefit by the new H/C bill in that it terminates the increases in taxes which were positioned to take effect in 2018 and continue in order to pay for Medicaid and subsidize lower income families. So, what is called a gift to the rich is simply a liberal lie. O'Care had already penalized almost ALL taxpayers, middle to high, by increasing their tax burdens to pay more for people who can't (in some cases) or won't (in others)! This amounted to a trillion dollars over the next 10 years!  This column is a perfect example of liberal lies and twisting the "facts" to come to a uninformed conclusion by the readers.
eng_test_651	When @wikileaks leak Trump's tax returns I'll start paying attention.
eng_test_652	Then there's kool-aid drinking "journalists" like David Pellegrin who write stories with titles like, "Five Officers Shot and Killed; Seven Wounded Amidst Peaceful Black Lives Matter Protest in Dallas".  Peaceful? Are you kidding me? Are you stupid?
eng_test_653	If we used a prerequisite of someone being elected to 'something', then we'd be twiddling our thumbs eh? There's always a first time.
eng_test_654	THEY DONT HUNT US!!!  They could, but they don't.  Reading that the freakin' idiot biologists went shooting crazy and killed 4 BEARS just because...Jesus Christ!!  I am so sorry about the young man killed by a bear.  He was out running in a wilderness area where, honestly, no one should be running without weapons and a couple of bear dogs.  Ive been up here a long time.  My daughter was going to participate in the mountain all night relay up at Hilltop that horrifying night when that lovely young teenage girl was attacked while riding her mountain bike through known bear hang outs in the middle of the NIGHT!  I honestly consider it stupid for this young man to have been alone in bear country!!!!!  I know his parents are feeling guilty for allowing him to do this race.  I know they are.  For the biologists, who always seem to over react up here in Alaska, for them to go out and kill every damn bear up there, is lunacy, but typical.  The whole thing is sickening and so sad.
eng_test_655	Just because in the past people's mental health was disregarded, doesn't mean that it was right. From my experiences and observations, it created a generation of adults who are miserable and unable to deal with their emotions or admit when they are in need of help. There is a reason suicide rates are so high, and if institutions are doing their part to potentially help decrease those numbers, then in my eyes that is a good thing.
eng_test_656	Wouldn’t you love to see the US Congress say, "Get that son of a bitch out of office right now. Out! He’s fired"?
eng_test_657	The sprinkler system, was not an issue, for what I had previously addressed.  The firefighting techniques & strategies, is what I am addressing.  Water or foam was not being utilized, while people were being rescued and/or evacuated.  From 2 buildings over, I did not see simultaneous efforts taking place.  The hose being used, did not have enough volume & pressure to knock down that fire.  I did not see a helicopter utilization, for either evacuations of victims or firefighter insertions.
eng_test_658	What an ignorant and useless article, not everyone prefers "cheap supermarket cake".  My little boy has a rare auto immune disease that requires diet restrictions, yet we don't choose Kelsey's & Applebee's as our dining choices (shame on you for bashing those who do should that be their preference or all they can afford for a special occasion).  We love that our kids enjoy a variety of dining experiences including fine dining and should I need to bring a special cake in that my WHOLE family can enjoy than that should be my prerogative at any restaurant.  In a time when so many suffer from all types of allergies & dietary needs, and when food is such an emotional and sometimes painful reality for so many, shame on you for making those who may not have a choice but to bring their own feel that they are lacking in class or "selfish".  Globe, you lost my readership for printing such garbage.
eng_test_659	Are they actually growing the tobacco and making the cigarettes on the reserves?  If the First Nations people can grow quality bud, I say have at 'er.

eng_test_661	Melania broke immigration laws by working in the US illegally for almost 2 months. Should we deport her and her orange buffoon husband?
eng_test_662	You know what is really racist and sexist....using your race or gender as a defense and calling someone racist any time you are questioned about something.   LIke Hitlerys health...it was sexist to question it just because she was a women.  Nobody cared when they bashed McCain or of she is sick.   OBozo has plenty of facts that make his birthplace a question.  Rather than address the facts they resort to name calling to distract. Damn hypocrites.
eng_test_663	Bryant is NOT Arenado's equal. Cubs fans are funny.... voting heavily to see their lesser talent ahead of the best.
eng_test_664	Giulia Gambacorta is one of Judge Zabel's lawyers, DB-TA, so I'm pretty sure she wasn't "smearing the judge"  or being a "bigot" or making a "completely baseless accusation" against him.  That's why limiting yourself to 'scraps of evidence' can end up making you look foolish.
eng_test_665	Health care saving accounts are the only true way to have real competition.  You have to be spending your own money, not taxpayer money to really care about it.  Also all medical costs at every level should be posted and the same for everyone.   You pay the same as everyone else for a loaf bread or a gallon of gas so why should medical care be any different?
eng_test_666	How about people, like you, who continue to be stupid. There are real victims of your stupidity. Shouldn't you be put away forever?
eng_test_667	Castle and Cooke should donate the land in partial settlement for the Heptachlor incident just for starters
eng_test_668	The cost to develop epi is about 20 cents a mg, (a pen holds .3 pediatric & .5 adult) the fancy injector can't cost more than 10$ at most. 1/10th the cost is still a rip off. My kids pediatric epi pen was almost 700$ for a duel pack. Even a 100% profit those two pens should not cost more than 40$. This is criminal, its armed robbery without the weapon.
eng_test_669	he's such a moron.
eng_test_670	This pResident, and those that are complicit in supporting him, desperately need a distraction from the ongoing investigation of him and his campaign.
eng_test_671	French immersion is popular essentially as parents know that any students with learning challenges will not be in the program - that results in concentrations of English classes and schools that do not have the required resources (eg. sufficient teaching assistants and special ed teachers). This is a huge erosion of the public school system and is not going to end well. This is not about learning French.
eng_test_672	Not so fast.   Once the church enters the secular world with paid employees in the U.S. ... the rules are different because they joined a new game.
eng_test_673	An ignorant failed       rebuttal. I expect no less from Ms. Kearon.
eng_test_674	How to explain Trump's comments?  Trump is an imbecile.  That's how to explain it.  His administration has failed and will continue  to fail.  He's a worthless POS.
eng_test_675	Look BJ, if you can sleep voting for the criminal enterprise know as the Clintons you're pretty pathetic.
eng_test_676	If your kid would stay in school for the rest of his life, would you still pay for his education or say enough already! Think about all the expense it will take to  keep the rail operating!!!
eng_test_677	This just proves how low and slimy the Republican senators are.  Loathsome pieces of garbage.  Almost, but not quite, as bad as Trump.
eng_test_678	How about a nickel for every fatwa issued in response to humorous cartoons depicting the Big M?  Perhaps if we use the coded reference 'Number 27', the pernicious influence of M103 can be averted?
eng_test_679	Actually they do receive Federal aid and  services and could receive more -which is a major  part of the desire to look closely at having land taken into trust.  Native healthcare , assistance with tribal courts- any number of government-to-government issues ...
eng_test_680	Not for the homeless. They get it for free cuz the tax payers will pay for it.
eng_test_681	We don't need to know how we are getting ripped off day after day month after month and year after year with this Rail. Write something else. You know the cost will not remain at 8.2 billion especially when the deadline is 2025. We don't need depressing news every morning when we wake up. Just let us know when we can hop on the damn thing.
eng_test_682	Nuke em and be done with the petty whiners
eng_test_683	Two wrongs don't make a right..
eng_test_684	Anyone can apply. The U.S. admits ~one million legal immigrants this year. You seem to consider these folks either too lazy or two stupid to be able to follow the rules.
eng_test_685	IRT - Peter - Your suggestion about involving China was tried by all previous presidents and now has been enacted by this president. Trump now has China threatening NK through the banking system. CHECK
eng_test_686	Agreed.  There is definitely more to this story than this initial story reports.  People have their own personal biases but most do not flame out like this tita on someone else for no good reason.  Road rage inspired perhaps?  We shall see.  Regardless, what she pulled is Attempted MURDER, and charges should be upgraded as such.  I would imagine that there is video that will paint a more accurate picture as to what led to this violent confrontation.
eng_test_687	and the never ending stupidity of the hate trump left continues, no idiots he cares enough to deal with a 20 TRILLION dollar debt thanks to obama
eng_test_688	Don't want to miss that Bed Bath and Beyond flyer! Wht you can do is hop in your car and go get your mail.  I prefer that no delivery drivers crash their vehicle, get hurt, hurt someone or cause any property damage while trying to valiantly deliver mail or anything else in hazardous conditions.  If a letter carrier gets stuck, say on an icy hill, they have to wait to get pulled out. There can only be so many risks and compensations.

eng_test_690	What? Under Harper, CETA was not ready to be signed. It had to be reviewed by legal experts, and translated into the other 22 EU treaty languages.
eng_test_691	Holly crap change the name to Bilery and it would be the same story!
eng_test_692	All I say is if these idiots looking for money then they better make the deadline for the Federal money. 1+ billion is a lot of money. And yet some idiots want to stop and reassess the project. Why? It's being built already and a lot of people went out of business or about to be. These guys have no clue and should be fired. Once Ige signs FINISH it.
eng_test_693	no more government money into the media. They do not deserve to be propped up when they are already dead from the *** up!!
eng_test_694	Massive spending?  Reagan's deficits over 8 years were lower than one year under Obama.  Stupid stupid liberal.
eng_test_695	It seems like every day the Globe hits a new low.  Uncritically reciting terrorist propaganda today. Shame on you scumbags.
eng_test_696	Thanks. I hope you will continue to ask questions. I know I will.
eng_test_697	The problem is stated in the article quite clearly.   Producers are figuring out how to release vast quantities of gas in fewer wells.  I was on a 5 well pad today and was talking to the operator. He told me how much they were producing from just 5 wells and it was enough to feed a small processing plant.   Put another way, each well was producing as much gas as 5 or more wells produced 5-10 years ago.  Even at today's low prices these producers are quite profitable.  But this vast surge in production in the 'deep basin' and 'montney' formations is quickly exceeding existing pipeline capacity.
eng_test_698	Mr. Cummings, you are are ignorantly uniformed.  Idiots like you prevent America from making any progress.  It's not TABOR you weak-minded fool!   It is a matter of political will.  Currently, "The Hick's" state budget gives $2.5 billion to RTD which carries just THREE percent of Colorado's commuters.  Meanwhile, the CDOT which carries the other 97% gets $1.3 billion.  It's not TABOR, it's the uneducated peons that The Denver Post appeals to.
eng_test_699	LOL. What kind of naive fool would trust GOOLAG and FAKEBOOK to tell the truth, rather than just the facts that suit them.   GOOLAG and FAKEBOOK are the biggest threat to human freedom since communism died.
eng_test_700	change the government.  kick liberals to the curb wherever they fester.

eng_test_702	Blah, blah, blah, more right wing nut idiocy, brought to you by one of the people who screwed Alaska for decades by voting Republican.
eng_test_703	The equal rights amendment never was ratified so gender is NOT covered really by anti-discrimination.  Women are still not equal under the constitution so I guess it's OK to discriminate in favour and against them in some cases.
eng_test_704	i wonder why those people who knows nothing about my country Philippines........ keeps barking on our President ................... F,,,,Ck you all....
eng_test_705	Sen. McCain sure has been through a lot in his life, and survived it all. And to still go to work with aggressive brain cancer, this guy is a warrior.

eng_test_708	What a scam! Get the hatchets out boys, she is making us look stupid.
eng_test_709	Oh. bull! Ever hear of the caste and class economy of India.  Those of a lower caste are called the untouchables.  Hill-larious is just as racist with deplorables!  Wind bag!
eng_test_710	Sorry folks. You've had decades and all you can do is produce bottom of the list results.  Your complaints and protests carry ZERO relevance. This group is just another unhinged pack of losers.
eng_test_711	And it only cost $10 trillion dollars doubling the national debt in 8 years. Obama has racked up more debt than all other presidents combined.  How's the billions wasted on debt servicing every month?  And your "self-sufficiency with oil" is a lot of garbage
eng_test_712	Pure fluff.  Waste of time.  President is "allowed" to ask his staff for loyalty and to fire anyone that works for him for whatever reason he chooses.  POOR LOSER DEMOCRATS - NOTHING THERE - ALL INNUENDO AND EMOTIONAL FLUFF.
eng_test_713	I selected my dad's marker for the VA cemetery and indeed all religions are represented and dad has a urn that is buried in an above ground columbarium and although dad was not religious, hence no religious symbol on his marker, I was pleased to see on that symbols of markers of all religions buried near him in that wall. That to me is what America is, freedom of religion and freedom from religion.

eng_test_716	Oh Groanin, another lapdog, MAGAphant post.  Hmmmmm.  Interesting your reference to urinals and shaking things.  Just like the baby-in-chief, are you also obsessed with male parts?  Hilarious.  By the way, moron, if these meetings were really nothing, why did they stay hidden for so long?  Like this whole Russia thing, if nothing's there, the baby-in-chief should move on, do his job and ignore it.  However, sane people (not you MAGAphants) pretty much have concluded that "where there's smoke, there's fire."  When someone acts guilty, they usually are.  At least that's what Fox and you Fox news lapdogs said during the campaign about Hillary (and I actually agreed with that point).  Please please post a response.  It's been a slow morning.

eng_test_726	My hope is that the traitor Putrumpski - and his hypocrital, lying, religious-nut wing man-back out of every, single bullshit promise they made in order to get votes, then defect to Russia with their criminal gains, where they're locked up and never seen or heard from again.   They don't deserve any respect by the outgoing president - a man of dignity and honor - or any real American.

eng_test_731	You are hateful and ignorant. Donald Trump is also a Christian. Quit name calling.
eng_test_732	you act like she knew he was going to do all of this to her? like she knew he was this "twisted". men put the "man" in manipulate, and you calling all women stupid because of a man's actions. your mother must be proud to born a sexist piece of shit. her family is probably reading every article and you saying something like this is probably making you look really really bad. speak on people who u personally know.
eng_test_733	Because you are that stupid.
eng_test_734	Actually if the eyes were a different colour that could be our PM under there.
eng_test_735	There is no place for religious accommodation in my Canada. Religions of every kind are a cancer on the human race that breed intolerance, contempt and ultimately violence by those who simply take their fairy-tales way too seriously. I don't care if you're Muslim, Christian, Jewish or Rastafarian; it's all nonsense.
eng_test_736	I am sorry Ron but Comey was fired was he not?  The Donald made a statement that would tend to indicate that he fired Comey because of the investigation.  Dispute this if you can:  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/us/politics/trump-russia-comey.html?_r=0
eng_test_737	I believe Parnell was being facetious. He was throwing back the words that 45 supporters use against those against this moron.
eng_test_738	ooQ...so you equate common sense laws with inane! I hope you never get to run anything important.
eng_test_739	Running like a coward? From what? The quasi-literate bunkum and noxious ad hominem vitriol that you spray like a rutting skunk?   That's not cowardice, Old Sport; it's simply good manners.  Hasta la vista, homo mephitis.
eng_test_740	"Canada was responsible for interrogating him while being sleep deprived. "  We violated our Charter laws on torture. That's the point.   The government also gave him over to a foreign government  for YEARS without trial by his peers and then relied on a very shaky confession obtained in Gitmo God knows how. That's the point. We don't torture. Canadian soldiers don't torture. Our government DID, as you admit in your previous post, and then we enabled the Americans to do it for 10 years. If you want to be the good guys you follow the law. The Conservatives are moral hypocrites on this one. They should have kept him in custody and tried Khadr in Canada for treason or whatever. They did not and that was stupid and immoral and,  illegal. Now they want us to spend more money and time on a case that cannot be won. Self righteous garbage.

eng_test_743	But when the plumbers, doctors and shop owners follow the rules they are called tax cheats.  Hypocrite.
eng_test_744	Oil pipelines and trains hauling oil are both disasters for the environment and the communities they pass through. Imagine waking up in the hell of that Canadian town when 40 some oil cars parked on a hill rolled into their town, crashed, exploded, and burst into flames that could not be put out. Or imagine living downstream from pipelines that burst open and pollute the water and land. NO THANKS! Oil companies are always crappy neighbors. You don't see any rich oil executives living next to their polluting infrastructure do you? There are hundreds if not thousands of oil leaks in just  the United States every year. The lack of concern for our land and water will be the death of humanity, sooner, rather than later.

eng_test_747	Chris Alexander has been an arrogant pompous jerk since he first appeared in the Harper Government. The fact that he keeps engineering face time on networks along with Kelly Lietch tell you were the conservatives are at.. Bankrupt
eng_test_748	thats a horrible accomplishment, but here comes the left wing fantasy of stupidity living outside economic reality
eng_test_749	It is pathetic that these colonised african states , once independence was attained , have all since managed to ruin their countries. What is even more pathetic is that they don't realise it.
eng_test_750	Deflect and lie, 45's best moves. Are you trumpsters getting tired of this bs yet? My dad and I have a bet going. I say 45 won't last 6 months. Dad gives him a year. It's looking pretty good that I will win this bet.
eng_test_751	[Ha! I saved this in case you deleted it]  "... the angry populist movement that lashes out at immigrants, Muslims and wants to turn back the clock." Yeah, turn back the clock to a time where we weren't getting blown up, stabbed, run-over, etc., for some stupid reason. What a ridiculous notion, eh?! I guess when you or your children get stabbed in the face you just smile and say "jolly good show!!!"
eng_test_752	So why isn't the man in New York that thinks he's a woman dressed in drag not fair game for mocking?  Not very inclusive of you lefties. Useless hypocrites is all I see

eng_test_759	Speaking of boiling over. If the oceans are going to be "boiling over", one would expect the sea level rise, (going on since the past ice age 10,000 years ago), would be increasing. Due to say melting glaciers, & water expanding when heated.  However looking at long term tidal gauges, supplied by PSMSL Liverpool UK, the global keepers of tidal data:   https://dc604.4shared.com/img/wlWKJ9lqca/s24/15c7f4d5af8/Holgate-9_1900-2016?async&rand=0.462408508762309  it would appear that no significant acceleration has occurred in the past 100+ years.   While words of sound & fury may sound alarmist, physical facts tell a far different story.  P.S. Have you noticed any good "ocean rise" fire sales of  property, around NYC Battery Park?
eng_test_760	Individual human rights to exploit others lacking bootstraps to pull themselves up with is what I'm writing about.   My take away from the Rand theme is selfishness is a virtue and greed makes the world go round. This is written by a welfare queen condemning government programs helping the poor.
eng_test_761	Over and over in the Muslim bible it tells them to kill all people who will not convert. This is not islamophobia people. This is the right to life! I have a right to live knowing if one of their people will kill me as I am a Christian. A Muslim student in the school I work at was screaming "I'll kill all Christian 's". So tell us again why we shouldn't be afraid??? Please? Tell me???

eng_test_765	People like critical reader are the ones that are harming America by playing into the hands of Putin.  Talk about stupidity.
eng_test_766	Trump is a rude child. Instead if acting like a leader he tweeted all weekend about NFL players, pandering to his zombie base. A real leader would have offered support, words of reassurance and asked for donations to help.  Instead he ignores 3.4 million AMERICANS suffering and dying and chastises men for peaceful prostest. Now that he has been called out, he sends out a bunch of disparaging tweets directed at Puerto Rico's leadership.   How can you defend that? That is not leadership, that is childish ego garbage. This latest display of a complete lack of leadership is sickening. I have no idea how anyone can support this buffoon.
eng_test_767	What a foolish comment
eng_test_768	And the ultimate in hypocrisy strikes again.  Keep it up hypocrite.  Maybe someday you will learn to actually give an intelligent response.
eng_test_769	Eugene Dude is a fool and an infidel.
eng_test_770	She was not really acquitted in the big scheme of things, she got a tongue lashing by the judge and had to pay her legal bills. That is not winning. The judge acquitted her due to the inability to really put a penalty on such a minor offence. That does not make her the winner. It actually makes her a pain. If she wants publicity-she can pay for an ad-not tie up our courts with this stuff.
eng_test_771	Research "the dancing boys" umm many are homosexual themselves, child rapists, woman haters.. Their entire culture is sexually perverse, backwards and should simply be destroyed. I think it has to do with deprivation of natural male and female relationships from dictatorship, censorship, whatever keeps them under HAND and GUN. Basically, they are easily manipulated and self destructed their entire society based upon those who want to control them. It's kind of pathetic really.
eng_test_772	If this soldier is guilty of the crimes he is accused of (essentially treason), he should be hanged!
eng_test_773	Terrorist attacks should not be included in the discussion because they are a different animal so to speak. Domestic violence is the issue in this case. Note that the incidents you posted were how may for each country compared to how many we've had in the U.S.  Violence happens everywhere, and all kinds of weapons are used. It's just that in the U.S., our level of violence using guns far surpasses other first world countries.

eng_test_776	No, it doesn't mean a safer America. But on the bright side you're a Racist! Congratulations, Jim Bob!
eng_test_777	I find myself in the rare position of agreeing with Kiszla.  CJ needs to establish himself as a threat to be highly respected.  I think he was on his way last year but got hurt (which I think was largely due to a horrible line Paradis excepted - everyone in the backfield was getting banged up).  I think he can do it if the line does its job.  All the "great" backs had great lines.  I hope these new players are up to the task.  It will mean the difference offensively.
eng_test_778	Poor Layla, never having had a job, doesn't know what working looks like.  First you criticize Trudeau for not planning a negotiating strategy with the US, and then you criticize him when he does just that.  That is simply partisan hypocritical behaviour.

eng_test_781	Oh sarge, you are just to predictable.  How many times do you MAGAphants bring up Hillary?  I love it that she's in your head and you can't get over the fact that you won.  Problem is that your baby-in-chief has to govern now and he and his lapdog followers (talking about you sarge) have no idea how to accomplish anything.  Hopefully they'll eventually do a TV series about you guys.  It would be a comedy.
eng_test_782	This sucks ass. Although, I guess I'll be ok with never having to go to Alberta ever again.
eng_test_783	This was a sports writer filling space, writing someting for publication. It is, of course, Mark Ksizla, so you don't expect much (kudos, Denver Post. For what, exactly? This guy is the best you can do?). But, seriously, Kiszla got flown out to LA to cover a game which he understands not at all and cares about even less as a kind of perk and to take his mind off of the total breakdown of the local football heroes. So what. He has a reprieve from writing about how awful the the Broncos are. But, seriously, at this point, does anyone care what Mark Kiszla has to say about anything? And can someone bitch-slap that shitty little hat off of his head?

eng_test_799	Depends on the charger. It's hard to find exact rates (and varies) but generally at cost, which is going to be a dime or 15 cents per kwh, maybe a bit more if you live somewhere with pricier power.   Perhaps you haven't seen them because you aren't looking. According to Chargehub, there are 15 level 2 stations in Winnipeg, and a level 3 one at Red River College. Not exactly rare.
eng_test_800	Great, balanced article!    There are two changes that would help the consumer.    1. More than half my bill is for things I cannot influence like "delivery".  A few years ago I went on a trip, shut down the house, used no electricity and the impact on my bill was minimal.  I still paid all these fixed costs.  In other words, conservation does not really reduce my bill. So the first change would be give me a small fixed charge and then charge me for the power I use.  That way, if I use less, I pay less.  2. For industry get rid of the "peak power" charge.  Hydro argues that if a company turns on a large load (say a big motor) then Hydro has to have the ability to meet this peak load.  They charge a huge amount for this peak load even if it is a few minutes.  This is another example where simply charging a reasonable rate for power used would save businesses a fortune.
eng_test_801	Great article, well written.  👍🏻
eng_test_802	Hi, I'm testing Civil comments :D
eng_test_803	Hey Les, among the things I dislike - no, make that despise - are hypocrits, opportunists, bigots and bullies.  In other words, Trump and his supporters.  And no, I'm not in need of "free stuff."  My educational and income levels are probably above yours - putting me well into the Hillary demographic.  Think about it.
eng_test_804	Ok, let me try it another way then - I've got 2 glasses of water in front of you and 2 identical digital TDS meters; I dip the TDS meters into the glasses of water, 1 in each glass; 1 meter reads 142, the other reads 0. Million dollar QUESTION: Which water would you like to drink?  (Realize that as early as my first comment here I've already dismissed the argument of tap vs. bottle - people who want THAT argument can read the article; I'm moving past that to a new and I think more salient question: are you satisfied with your tap water?)
eng_test_805	Russia and China are trying to squeeze us acting very aggressively against us in opposite ends of the world.  Invite China to RIMPAC?  Are we nuts or what?  No invitation went out to Russia?  China better take care of the N. Korea problem.  If not disinvite them.  Stupid.
eng_test_806	And then there is Hillary......but we'll give her a pass.

eng_test_816	were tired of your despicable lies
eng_test_817	Disgusting, repulsive, and other similar adjectives. The hypocrisy of the hijacked Republican Party, along with the now completely irrelevant Evangelicals, who eagerly climbed into bed with the devil, knows no bounds. A laughing stock if it weren't for the crying over the dearth of decency, and the divisive, guttural garbage coming from what I can only describe as a mentally ill candidate, hell-bent on creating a new (facist) Trump Party, who says: 'to the devil' with all decent Republicans, who have already bravely disenfranchised themselves from what will go down in history as the most disgraceful presidential candidate ever. Make your stand Alaska. Your vote is "Wheat from the Chaff" time, so stand up and be counted!
eng_test_818	You are ignorant, Bill. Niggardly is a middle English word that means "miserly" or "lacking in generosity", and predates the "N-word" by centuries. The two words aren't related. Today you posted that you don't know what radon is, yet you continue to challenge the science of climate modelling as though you knew any science, which you obviously don't. You don't know science even at a high school level. Now, out of ignorance, you accuse me of using a racist word which has nothing to do with race. You do that out of pure ignorance.  You are completely ignorant of the law. You insist that undocumented Mexicans (that's what we are talking about here) are not only criminals, which they are not; you insist that they are racists, robbers and murderers. You said so plainly. You are a bigot.  Nor can you read. What Motley posted said clearly that first offenders in violation of specific immigration laws MAY BE tried on misdemeanor charges. Clearly they are not criminals, they are in violation.

eng_test_823	this is a very confusing article, not sure what the message is but it is not really about Jordan and gates; the problem between them appear to be an example that the writer uses to denigrate sanders and his supporters who believe that the dnc rigged the primary process.   and that sanders supporters presumably democrats were supporting someone who is not a democrat but a professed socialists who was using the democratic party to further his misguided principles.  hence, in a sense sanders rigged or tricked the democratic party into allowing him to run as a democrat while not really being one and using it for his own personal and political ambitions.  This ruse was unfair, yet the sanders supporter including vandeveer and finger flipping kent failed to understand or if they did, did not care because of their hypocrisy charging that the dnc rigged the primaries in favor of Hillary.  two wrongs don't make a right.
eng_test_824	Wow, what a great analysis! Did your extensive experience watching Law & Order while falling asleep provide your legal training?
eng_test_825	Get a job, slackers!
eng_test_826	As I've said before, the single most important take away from the 2016 elections is incontrovertible truth that a large percentage of Americans are stupid. Not only that, they're proud of it. Their continued support of Trump simply confirms that fact.  The bigger question is what to do about it, because as we all know, you can't fix stupid.
eng_test_827	What a BOZO
eng_test_828	Thank you, Bob.  Good to know we are still able to speak the truth in a small town newspaper.  Will read your booklet more carefully when I have time.

eng_test_830	So you just doubled down on his comments by saying an Alaska Native could not possibly be a "tipping customer." My god. Please go educate yourself, you really come across as quite ignorant. There's no reason to defend this guy.
eng_test_831	I completely disagree.  A quality low cost public education system is the foundation of a free and healthy society. It has helped raise the masses out of poverty in America. I agree there are areas that need improvement, and do believe the states should have more autonomy, and money should be sent from the Federal level without so many restrictions. If education were privatized, it would become another funding stream for the wealthy, and that is exactly what Trump and his allies are trying to do.

eng_test_837	What idiot came up with this solution?  You've got to be kidding!  Apparently the traffic planners have never driven on the Seward Highway.
eng_test_838	You are a joke.
eng_test_839	Actually, Larry ..  Roy isn't the one arguing that the political justice system is largely composed of educated people. That is muzungu's position. And educators do stress critical thinking skills at most universities. Given your displayed hostility toward higher education, I'm going to go out on a limb and ask you exactly how much experience you've had in higher ed, which seems relevant given your apparent lack of knowledge demonstrated by your belief that education doesn't make one think. Truly, it sounds as if you'd never had the experience so as to ascertain the facts for yourself.
eng_test_840	So...the sound of a human voice will cause lions to run, regardless of political persuasion?  What a ridiculous study.  They could have just as easily used the narrator from Disney nature movies, Bill Nye, a clip from Modern Family or Jeopardy.  How can you take people seriously who try to make some political statement with a "scientific" study?  Frankly, I can't believe zoologists don't already know this.  What actual new knowledge was gained from scaring wild animals away from their dinner?  Seems like a waste of money and a blatant "look at us!" ploy by folks craving publicity.

eng_test_849	BRO...I seriously object to NCR printing this essay....
eng_test_850	"In older people, he noted, blood-sugar levels normally rise as the pancreas produces less insulin and the body becomes more insulin-resistant. "  Normally? "Typically" perhaps, but rising blood sugar is not normal. What we call type two diabetes is simply a later stage condition of prolonged hyperinsulinemia. Perhaps the best diagnostic test is the 5-hour test of serum insulin as part of a glucose tolerance test. An exaggerated insulin response or delayed insulin clearance indicates the disease condition has started. The body is struggling to metabolise carbohydrates at that point.  Recent studies suggest some 75% of American adults have insulin resistance.  The simple solution is to reduce the insulin load on the body. This can be done easily through a shift in diet away from foods with higher insulin load (especially added sugar) and moderate exercise after meals, to make the insulin process more efficient.
eng_test_851	Who really cares?  Now, lets talk turkey?!  The NY terrorist said that he hated gays.  Where is that story?  The progressive agenda is why the Terrorist hate us.  You are to blame!  And you have the unmitigated gall to tell us about some silly Trump business deal?

eng_test_855	Are you kidding? Hillary was in bed with Putin.
eng_test_856	Yeah, like degrading democracy?  The mainstream (no alt-right) media is there to keep us informed when we are subject to a dizzying array of anti-democratic garbage thrown our direction daily. Happily our informed and educated media have been absolute heroes, and the tide has turned as Republicans finally, finally realize a criminal is representing their party.  Better times ahead as Mueller moves closer to honestly appraising what level of fetid corruption we have been smelling from day 1 of this unfortunate American experiment.

On the environment - focus on pollution (SOx, particulates, water/soil contamination) first.

If someone has sex with the person who is asleep, too inebriated or passed out, they are a RAPIST. I don't care if you are more violent. RAPE IS RAPE. You may have urges, CONTAIN THEM. I am so disgusted by this coming from an attorney! Perhaps the Bar Association should look into his ability to practice law.
eng_test_867	Another great concept is police and fire protection. I've never been the victim of a fire, and I have little use for corrupt police, so who pays for that junk that I don't need or want? I don't need healthcare either (until I need it). You're really smart, como.
eng_test_868	Yes, for the sake God the almighty please listen to Shisaisama the humble and devout Christian and give Trump a chance!  After all, Trump is very Jesus-like.

Like the way the collective farms went in Cambodia.  I would rather go with my partial ownership of something and work my way up to full ownership. Especially if it means I have to earn that ownership and it's not just a given. Mostly because I have heard of the tragedy of the commons before.
eng_test_892	'Holy Mother Church'? What an exquisitely silly phrase for an institution marked by historical misogyny. 😅
eng_test_893	incepitfidelis,  There is a bit of slight of hand at play here.  The US consumer pays more than the store sticker price for dairy & poultry products.  This added payment is in the form of very large Government subsidies to dairy & poultry producers which, as taxpayers, these consumers contribute towards.  If Canada abandoned supply-management, then either (a) we would lose most of our domestic dairy & poultry producers, or (b) we would have to pay our producers subsidies sufficient to create a level playing field with US producers.
eng_test_894	If it were only calling out speech that is offensive, I'd be okay with that. However, it seems many have taken it one or two steps further and prevented or attempted to prevent people from speaking in ways the were found to be offensive. That's a step too far.
eng_test_895	bryant, my cause is making education equitable for all kids, through cell phones and tablets and free island wide wifi. my studies show that kids of any age learn more, faster and retain more using technology and their peers than they do from 1950s style of classroom teaching. all ages. a three year old can learn to make a video and upload it to youtube in a couple hours watching older kids doing it. zilch when watching a teacher try to explain it to thirty kids at once. kids seven to ten can produce a professional presentation on any subject they choose in hours if they get to choose the subject. no they dont automatically make music video. they most likely choose a local, community oriented project and youtube has millions of them. im in an english class now that has us making reports on life and death of moths, poems about cars and heaven and hell. what has that got to do with earth 2017? imagine 25,000 UH students all tackling homelessness as a group?
eng_test_896	The boom in Irish whiskey sales has far less to do with Kate Perry, Lady Gaga, et al. and more to do with the shake up that John Teeling gave the industry when he started up the Cooley distillery in 1987. The notice Cooley garnered, combined with the overall increase in sales of brown spirits globally (especially on the super-premium end of things), pushed the Irish Distillers Limited to revitalize their brands.  A good pure pot still whiskey is a glorious thing; most any expression of Redbreast (save for the 15YR) is worth picking up. Insofar as Jameson goes, Caskmates is pretty much the least worthy of their product line.

eng_test_904	That's totally false, debunked years ago. The science is clear. The scientific consensus among climatologists is 97%.

eng_test_916	Not just Mexico  This underlines the reality that central Americans are coming because of poverty, lack of jobs, threats to family, crime, death squads, drugs, etc.  It acknowledges their right to seek a better life vs. some esoteric national right to preserve our security (whatever that means).

eng_test_924	I think it is kinda funny how it is said that the dude was Nazi.  I would guess that the dude knows virtually nothing about that group of almost 100 years ago.  So the dude goes around drawing swastikas.  A Nazi, that does not him make - just an idiot.
eng_test_925	I'm concerned- amongst a million other things, about the President Elect separating himself from his business. His kids were supposed to take it over- which was shaky from the get go- but now it seems they will be part of the inner circle.. He and his family need to separate themselves fon the business for the next four years- I'm not sure they can. This could turn into the Clinton Foundation times 10 with one conflict of interest issue after another..
eng_test_926	No, just a plane and stupid ideas. Quebec will never get a grid like that. We in the  west have supported Quebec for to long. Now the West should separate from the East. We will look after ourselves and they can feed themselves.

eng_test_942	There may always be traffic accidents and criminals..but we, as a society, have determined that it's reasonable to to license and insure vehicles and have traffic safety laws and other laws to minimize the problems for the sake of the majority. I, for one, will not remain silent while innocent people in church, in schools, in movie houses, at work places continue to be shot by those with a history of violence and mental disturbance. America can do better while still preserving everyone's second amendment rights.
eng_test_943	yep, that Obama... he's really bad! why, the lazy goat can't even keep up with trump's hate-spew cos he's faithfully sound asleep at 3am with his loving wife instead of always tweeting nasty lying insanity. and those darn Obama kids, can't they show some spunk and get out there on another vacation safari and kill plenty of innocent animals merely for pleasure? really, what do these Obamas have better to do, collude with Russia against us, or scam and graft themselves silly before getting busted?
eng_test_944	Well, that was a lie-fest... Talk about pulling numbers out of your behind (insert eye roll here)... What a stupid article.
eng_test_945	>>.., stupid. . Well, you certainly are not stupid in conveniently ignoring the questions in my post  and providing irrelevant facts ( a trademark of yours). . So let me ask again   - How many non-Muslims choose to immigrate to Muslim countries?
eng_test_946	I do find the coincidence of the story about Russia being drown out by yet another provocation by NK to be suspicious at best.  Yet another business deal with implications about Russia interfering in our election.  Then suddenly a provocation by NK who only does military maneuvers with Russia.  Seems like a lot of coincidence all at once the third time in a row.

eng_test_952	Clarification:  You can blame the lead in your water if you're cognitively compromised, but not if you're a jerk. That's entirely on you.   There's No correlation between cognitive limitations and  jerkiness.  In fact, jerkiness is more commonly found among those who appear to have high functioning brains.
eng_test_953	How can anyone be so stupid or to knowingly kill someone when they know what the lifetime consequences are going to be. This will tell one story of why I guess.
eng_test_954	...which is why most people roll their eyes at "doctors" of various fields.  For many, it is just the way to get the most potential out of having to do as little actual work as possible.
eng_test_955	Black on black killings.  Stop this madness, man, stop it now.  All of you criminal-minded shooters.
eng_test_956	Respectfully I disagree.  These "kids" were well aware of the consequences but just didn't care.  At age 22 everyone knows killing is wrong except in unusual rare circumstances.
eng_test_957	On the other side of the coin:  "A judge has reopened a major legal controversy by ruling that accused people can claim they were too drunk to be found culpable of committing crimes. Presiding over a sexual assault case in Southwestern Ontario, Mr. Justice Terrence Patterson of the Superior Court of Ontario ruled that Parliament violated the Charter of Rights with a 1995 law that prohibits the so-called defence of excessive intoxication. The ruling opened the door for Carl Frederick Fleming, 62, to argue that he was too drunk to appreciate his actions when he sexually assaulted a St. Thomas, Ont., woman in 2009."  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/judge-reinstates-controversial-drunkenness-defence-in-sex-assault-case/article578863/  So, in this case one of the old boys club (aka judges) decided that a man can be too drunk to sexually assault someone..but on the other hand, a woman who is too drunk to control her own bladder can consent to sex. Something has to change.
eng_test_958	99% of all negotiations whether with the government or the private sector are done in secret.  This is normal practice.

eng_test_961	When you're offering "low wages" it can be hard to get staff.   Surprise!!!! So, guess what ... in a market economy, you can raise wages to recruit more. Shocker!!!!! This article is bizarrely stupid but reveals the special pleading and treasonous attitudes of the restaurant industry.
eng_test_962	For me, the difference between Russia and China is that China, so far, seems content to make piles of money making the world's consumer products and has no westward expansionist intentions.  Putin appears to want to expand his sphere of influence as much as possible – to regain the lost Soviet territory at the very least.  So while China is possibly worse in terms of the treatment of its own citizens, Russia is a bigger danger to the rest of us.  As for "objective", is it really being too subjective to base one's opinion on years of past experience? Russia under Putin is not a fair-minded operator. It is very much out for its own interests and comfortable being as ruthless as necessary.
eng_test_963	Maybe in Canada, but this happened in the US. They are a bit different down there.
eng_test_964	Many of the NATO members have arms like alligators and crocodiles  They come to a pot luck picnic with nothing or maybe a small bag of chips and eat like pigs.

eng_test_970	Take your damn phone out of your ear in court.
eng_test_971	Larry you just figured out that for yourself and your argument has a historical basis, the fact is that this nation was founded using English Civil Law and specifically not on Church Laws. That was the intent for many good reasons of being able to be free from a state religion in the newly formed nation.  Freedom from religion from all the wars, deaths and persecutions it caused was the purpose.
eng_test_972	Glad he's gone. Stay that way Obama and shut your mouth. Keep your opinions to yourself.
eng_test_973	How do Republicans continue to support him? They're women-hating rapo scumbags just like him. They want to do to the entire country what they've been doing to women for years that's why they elected a sex abuser. The Republican party at its core is misogynist.  They want to perform their psycho-sexual fantasies upon the entire body politic which they view much like the body of a woman. They're rabid.
eng_test_974	Even social activism can't get around economics and these workers should know they are paid based on their productivity. If they want more pay, figure out how to be more productive.
eng_test_975	I am not saying you are a moron, but your comment is moronic. When rates were higher, borrowers took on less debt so a 1 or 2% increase in their mortgage rates not only caused a lesser percentage increase in the rate., but it was on a much lower amount of debt. Today, someone with an $800,000  mortgage outstanding facing an increase in mortgage rate from 3 to 5% faces a much larger increase to their payments than someone in the past who was facing an increase from 10 to 12% on $150,000.

I miss Steven Harper don't you?
eng_test_984	What I said was that the LA Basin has more oil per square meter than any other basin in the world. I can go to Wikipedia and get field sizes as well, but my information comes form the Pacific AAPG, as well as working with the top geologists and reservoir engineers in CA. As for Plaquemines Parish one only needed to know Judge Leander Perez or his family.
eng_test_985	Huh?!  Twenty two units on that small of a property is code approved?  That's hard to believe.  I have a 55' x 75' open area and the city refuses a secondary dwelling.  I'd like to see the code that authorizes the 22 units, and a building permit for each.
eng_test_986	I will stand by my statement that liberalism is what smart looks like to stupid people.   The letter states the real problem clearly enough. " It doesn't matter if it was protected by the First Amendment." I have legal news flash for the University of Oregon. Because the University is public and receives government tax dollars it is indeed bound to abide by the US constitution with All OF IT'S PROTECTION INCLUDED. Which should  tell everyone right off the signatories are anti-American, and perhaps even anti-America in their twisted PC nonsense.   Secondly this H****S*** letter does not speak for everyone in "our community" And only sanctimonious hypocrites write letters being with "Dear" and ending with "Sincerely".   Who do these stupid liberals believe they are kidding?
eng_test_987	bigotry If a person is intolerant of other ideas, races, or religions, we call that person a bigot. The intolerance expressed by that bigot is called bigotry. Bigotry is ugly.  A leftist is intolerant of other ideas.  A leftist is intolerant of any race that they do not support.  A leftist basically is intolerant of all religions, except those that they support.  Do you not see how ugly you are?

eng_test_991	Since the past two generations, education has focused primarily on math, science, and similar discursive technological "black-white" studies.  Literature, religions, languages, fine arts, and philosophy became empty caboose while two fellow gray venues -- political science and law -- became elite professions.  Today, the common populace more and more polarizes in their myriads of black-and-white existences while the politicians and lawyers mine gold therefrom as "Masters of the Gray."

eng_test_996	Almost every week I read gov Walker is spending more and more on this estimated cost $45 - $65 billion dollar gas line project at a time he is doing his damnedest to take the PFD, initiate and increase taxes, Continuing oil subsidies, hiring contractors left and right while a hiring freeze is inforce. Buying TransCanada's intrest in the gas line at $45 million. Doing the exact opposite of what he said he would do if elected. My observation is he is hell bent on this gas pipeline and doesnt give a damn what Alaskans think. Sounds just like Frank Murkowski and the  lear jet he bought, and said he didnt give a damn if Alaskans liked it or not. These Governors need to start careing what Alaskans want. Do what you were elected to do: TRIM THE GOVERNMENT SPENDING! That includes the natural gas pipeline until is at least until we have a ballanced budget. Be held accountable for the campaign pledges made "will not touch the PFD or initiate new taxes. Recall gov Walker.

Hillary is still free.  lol  I think it is time to lock Donald up for his own good.  He is definitely unhinged.
eng_test_999	Uh are you dimwitted or what? If you don't know these laws you should google something or speak with the professionals.  You do travel with papers that are signed by a doctor that verify your need for a service animal.  It can be a note scribbled on a prescription pad or a short letter but it never says why you need the animal.    Only simply that you do need the animal.  That's the point, she had the email from her doctor specifiying her need for the animal which is all that's required.  These people wanted to know the reason for her need of the dog and that's NONE OF THEIR DAMN BUSINESS.  Now this is what will happen.  I know from personal experience. Quite a few ppl will be fired because crap rolls downhill.  She will settle this out of court they will give her free flights for like a year and some monetary amount that she won't be able to discuss because they don't want the negative publicity.  I've gone this road and won more than once.

eng_test_1004	The potential discovery and development of oil and gas deposits in Quebec is great news for both Quebecers and Canadians in other provinces.

eng_test_1006	Dipper 1945, This is not the approach to deal with Trump.  The more that you stand up to him the more he likes it.  The best way to deal with idiots like this is to isolate them.  Canada and Mexico have circled their wagons and drawn in governors of many states,  leaders in business, large companies, and elite economy experts to load the guns that will shoot down this lame-duck president.
eng_test_1007	How is reporting the news disrespecting the president? The governor clearly has asked the Oregon AG to pursue legal remedies. I consider that newsworthy, don't you?
eng_test_1008	There is nothing -- absolutely nothing -- required of you upon reading a letter that does not meet your approval. If you must react, you can roll your eyes, shake your head, mutter under your breath or just bask in the comfort of knowing you're not one of "those"people. Or you can come here, rationalize how you're superior to "those" people and then proceed to tell the few of them you can force yourself to tolerate how they should live their lives. What's lost on the aspiring fool is that either approach has the same effect with one caveat: the latter has the benefit of removing all doubt.

eng_test_1015	I have to agree with local media here. Neither of those statements are racist whatsoever . But the fact he twisted it and played the racist card is pretty much expected. Minority’s have all the power . They can be racist by calling white peple racist and it’s okay. But muslims are the biggest racist around .  Just look around the world. Muslims are at war everywhere over race and religion. Everywhere. So for a Muslim to play the racist card. Would only work in Canada. Pathetic
eng_test_1016	This is so stupid.

eng_test_1020	Please be sarcasm, please be sarcasm, please be sarcasm...
eng_test_1021	Sorry, but sales is not a discipline that requires much study. Speaking from experience, most sales people don't take sales training, or sales trainers, very seriously. Sales training is mostly a conflation of motivational speakers and pop psychology 'analytics'. Real sales people focus on building relationships using their personality assets, manipulation skills, and goal-oriented drive. Sometimes, keeping 'ethics' at a safe distance helps too.  I worked for the 2nd largest computer company during the 80s and 90s selling very large computer systems and services to 'Fortune 100' corporations. We were frequently subjected to sales training courses and had to attend retreats at hotels, off-season resorts, and even college campuses. It was mostly meaningless and tedious, but often we had some pretty good blowouts with plenty of expense account paid drinking, fancy dining and flirting. Universities could never come to grips with that sort of expense and debauchery for mere students.
eng_test_1022	Anyone who has had the pleasure of meeting Ms Freeland, or hearing her speak, knows her to be remarkably intelligent and very intense, but at all times eloquent. She has an excellent sense of humour, which she will need to face international and domestic challenges.  I saw several comments from people who don't seem to appreciate how valuable a civil servant of Ms Freeland's caliber is at the international level. It is clear they know nothing about her and are only speaking blithely and recklessly from their ideological bias. This is both sad and unfortunate, because right now we need people to pay attention and speak from knowledge. We need people to be constructive and positive, and to stand behind their country as much as they claim to be standing on guard for it in our anthem.
eng_test_1023	The unfortunate reality is a lot of our legislatures weren't elected to deliver good government. They are down there in Juneau to battle Planned Parenthood, bring prayer into the schools, promote the interests of the oil industry, and line their own pockets.

eng_test_1031	Because of state-by-state winner-take-all laws, not mentioned, much less endorsed, in the Constitution. . .   In 2000, 537 popular votes in Florida determined that the candidate who had 537,179 less national popular votes would win.  Less than 80,000 votes in 3 states determined the 2016 election, where there was a lead of over 2,8oo,ooo  popular votes nationwide.  Since World War II, a shift of a few thousand votes in 1, 2, or 3 states would have elected a 2nd-place candidate in 6 of the 18 presidential elections

eng_test_1047	I agree with you Wavemaker, but there is another side to that story.  Many of these off-grid communities have had opportunity for being brought into the road system, but they were all about not wanting "strangers" having easy access to their back yard.  They fought easier access tooth and nail, having now made their bed that they must lay in.  The military railroad from Fairbanks to Nome was surveyed-in decades ago, but many of the communities along the proposed route said "No way!".  My company is interested in building it, but if the locals fight it, and maybe go as far as to bring the EPA into the fray, to preempt it? Well, I have other fish to fry.

eng_test_1053	A major failure of the University of Alaska statewide system is a lack of a school of architecture anywhere in Alaska. We’re one of the few states without one. In the West, Idaho is the only other lacking entity although they have architectural engineering programs, and they’re on the interstate highway system where their citizens can access other architecture schools in nearby states. There’s no way Alaska would have had a school of architecture back in the 50s when Fairbanks was “blossoming,” but there also have been many architectural catastrophes in Alaska since then too. This is yet another “be careful what you ask for” Alaska architectural train wreck. Across Fairbanks town--they also have the UAF Fine Arts Complex, which has screamed out for repairs from architectural hemmorhaghing ever since that place originated decades ago. Very expensive, very much from Alaska's treasury, money money money.

Apparently you cannot click YES to the "Is this comment civil" question, if others have decided it is not civil. The problem is (1) how do you know others have classified it as uncivil, and (2) I have a very liberal and tolerant attitude when it comes to free speech. Obviously I draw a line in the sand on some posts but generally speaking I tend to err on the side of caution when it comes to censorship.  It seems by disagreeing with them and clicking YES, you can have your account restricted. This is just not right by any yardstick.
eng_test_1110	Thank goodness Suzette Cook will finally be gone.  When Jim White was mayor, the downtown districts were clean and well maintained.  Street sweepers would come through once per week, and gravel shoulders in the residential portion were maintained. Under Suzette Cook, the people living in the downtown area have been neglected.  People who complained about the lack of maintenance were told the could levy a special improvement tax on themselves if they wanted things fixed.  The roads in the area I live in are in extremely poor condition.  I've not seen any maintenance since Cook took office.  Suzette Cook was more interested in the industrial parks than the neighborhoods of Kent.   I'll be closely watching what the mayoral candidates have to say about working for the residents.  I'd be happy with a better balance between the needs of the residents vs. the needs of business.   Good-bye Suzette, it can't happen soon enough.

eng_test_1121	John, in the earth's history, the CO2 concentration has been much higher than it is today, as has the global temperature.  Also, the CO2 emitted by volcanic activity dwarfs that  emitted by humans.  Thus, I don't see the rationale for saying, "it should be kept between 250 and 350 ppm."  No one has any idea what is the "proper" concentration; indeed, there is no such thing.  The earth and its atmosphere is a gigantic feedback mechanism.  For example, increases in CO2 concentration increase photosynthesis, which converts CO2 to O2 and glucose.  Also, the oceans are a major absorber of CO2 (and no, it does not make the oceans "acidic"--a politicized term--the ph always stays above 7.0), where it gets incorporated into tissue and hard shells of marine organisms and/or dissolved in the polar regions and circulated into the deep oceans.  Increased CO2 concentration results in increased absorption.  I'm frankly more worried about global cooling due to reduced solar activity.

eng_test_1139	Don't believe the APA, they are weasels as well as scum trying a CYA, as usual: In DSM-III, APA said that one who acted upon one's sexual attraction to children was a PEDOPHILE. But then in DSM-IV, the APA changed its criteria, stating that pedophilia was ONLY a "disorder" if it “caused clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning.”  The APA organ Psychological Bulletin published the Rind study:  finding that man-boy “consensual” relationships were not necessarily harmful. Subsequent to the public outcry related to the Rind study, APA said moral values trumped the scientific study. In the original printing of DSM-5, “pedophilia” was changed to a “sexual orientation,” but another public outcry led APA to admit an “error” that was to be "corrected" in “the next printing of the manual.” And now they say that Trump is crazy, and that they are credible. Clearly, the reverse is the truth.

eng_test_1163	A religious zealot that is not narrow minded? Hypocrite. I hope you can thank Jesus for lymphoma he gave mankind moron.
eng_test_1164	This was totally predictable once the ratings began to come in. The NFL is a totally commercial organization driven only by money. The gesture toward political correctness never stood a chance against declining ad revenues and possible TV-deals melting down.

Israeli intelligence and Chinese and  Russian intelligence and the British and the French and especially the CIA are all over that place.

eng_test_1175	morneau is a bumbling idiot - almost as pathetic as junior.  they just close their eyes to chinese money laundering.  where the hell is the CRA and Fintrac - pathetic all of them.  stop giving away our country to the lowlives from china.

When the driver arrived at my place of employment & left the cab of his truck he had difficulty walking & talking while smelling of alcohol.  Lots of jobs across Canada have employees who pose danger to the public due to their substance addictions.

eng_test_1206	"We hope Coffman prevails"?   Do keep in-mind that about 80% of Metro-Denver sits above potential coal-bed methane fracking rights including every bit of land within 8-10 miles of downtown, and also know that coal-bed methane fracking already has a miserable environmental impact record west of Trinidad too.    Basically if Coffman and the pro-oil lobby prevails, large parts of Colorado won't be worth living in if you are at-all worried about your health and/or that of your family.

Now, Trump is ready to turn the party into a brawl because of his ego.  Kim is dangerous.  Trump is the madman playing with a rattlesnake, going, "See?  It's harmless.  This stupid snake can't hurt me", ASKING to get us all bit by an angry snake.

eng_test_1218	Divide and conquer. Obama--create division between races, create division between law enforcement & communities, create division between religions, create division between socio-economic groups. The plan has worked very well because the stupid Republicans are stupid. Now Hillary is following the same game plan! Give me a break!!  The idiot Trumpster is falling for it, Cruz swallowed it hook, line and sinker as have the Never Trump folks. Just elect Hillary already you idiots!!  The Trumpster is the poster child for NOT PC!! Most people with half a brain & who are intellectually honest don't buy into how 'offended' people say they are by what the Trumpster says.   The biased media demands it and stupid politicians looking out for their own best interest (i.e. McCain) get all righteous and PC and take the bait!  When is the last time a democrat criticized Hillary? Even Obama & 'Mr. Feel the Bern' ate the turd sandwich for Hillary.  It's about the economy stupids and I'm not that smart.

eng_test_1227	You don't get it. I am not saying Trump is a great man. Yes he has lied. That said Hillary Clinton has lied her whole career. Heck she even got caught with her comments about having public and private positions. When you look up the word liar int he dictionary Hillary Clinton's picture is there.  Also Bull crap on the sexism, rasism, xenophobia etc. Liberals throw those labels at everyone who opposes them. Sorry but you have cried wolf so long no one believes you.  I am a moderate not a conservative and I know the ways both conservatives and liberals argue their points both has stupid arguments at times. But the left always throws those labels out when they are losing. Here is a good video for you to watch.  https://www.facebook.com/JonathanPieReporter/?pnref=story   I honestly don't like a lot of things about Trump but your party put forth a candidate that was worse.

The title of the article conveys an embarrassing impression that a Canadian Prime Minister has to bow and scrape in this fashion to get noticed by the high and mighty. Or was Trudeau just seeking attention?

eng_test_1236	You had me until this:  "and revealed concerns that poor reporting by real estate agents has made the industry vulnerable to money laundering."   How are readers supposed to discern valid writing from just print which fills up pages in a news source when drivel like what is quoted above is printed?  Realtors are required to comply with Fintrac imposed anti-money laundering laws.  We cannot even submit listings or mandates to our offices unless the Fintract forms are duly filled out and submitted.  The quotation is gratuitous fluff that belies a lack of understanding of the real estate industry and diminishes the credibility of the writer.  Secondly, it perpetuates the malicious myth that Realtors as a class of profession have practiced their profession in a collectively deficient way so as to be a root cause of money laundering.  This is a false premise.    Can the writer point out any cases where Fintrac reporting violations on the part of Realtors has lead to successful prosecution?

eng_test_1243	we see the childish idiot in your post
eng_test_1244	After reading through all of the comments to this op/ed, I went back and re-read it to see if I had "missed" something.  What I get when I read this is, a opinion about a large, rich corporation that went after attorney fees in a case that they were not being sued.  I took this op/ed to be about how going after the legal fees for the Corporation who was never sued. However, there was another piece of land (separate from this case) that the Corporation took issue with but the Corporation LOST in that case.  The op/ed is talking about how a big corporation used a case they were not being sued in to get the fees as a retaliation for the other case and as a way to intimidate anyone who would dare take on the Corporation. Why is that important ? Because a number of shareholders are very unhappy right now and allege that there is wrong doing by  Corporation board. That this ruling will be used to let the shareholders know that if you try to take on the Corp, the Corp will win at all costs.

Notimpressed with her stupid story or her comments, not a fan of Cam's but this whole incident is beyond stupid.
eng_test_1255	First, please view my post from above that sites an article from the Center for Sex Offender Management. I am not solely siting one doctor. However, even if I was, there are multiple doctors that have contracts in Alaska to treat sex offenders and they all, including DOC, have a consensus on the accuracy of the statistics in this report.   Second, under reporting and recidivism isn't necessarily the same thing. To my understanding, the assailants in a good portion of under reported incidents are not prior convicted and treated sex offenders. They may have multiple victims on multiple occasions but these numbers largely reflect people who have not yet been caught. Once caught and rehabilitated THEN the rate at which they reoffend is much lower than general crimes.   I really hope you don't think I am defending sex offenders over victims. To make myself clear, I feel for victims of sexual assault, my wife was trafficked at a young age by her own father. But we both have the opinion...

eng_test_1267	Agree - more WaPo garbage.
eng_test_1268	Trump's Fascist message is the last thing we need in Canada. What we need to do is offer to the world an alternative message, one of reason and tolerance, of decency and peace. The world does indeed need more Canada and for Leitch to suggest otherwise shows she knows nothing at all about what it means to be Canadian. Shame on her for this appalling statement.

It took me a little longer than two seconds (not much) to confirm what I knew before I looked: you are lying about this. The source of your distortion is apparently an article on Breitbart ... er, I mean LifeSite (who can tell the difference?) The EO person quoted in the article was speaking only about access to rental facilities, not about requiring anyone in any venue to perform a same-sex wedding. Moreover, it is not even clear from the LifeSite article that the position articulated by the EO official is the position of EO itself. The context of the article is the Pastor Protection Act (PPA), purporting to protect a right which no-one is attacking.

eng_test_1288	So ignorant of Hispanic culture yet you pine to be one?
eng_test_1289	Where do you dig up this crap, Agirl, and why do you buy into it? Do you have a clue?  True, the segregationists in Congress and Southern state government were Democrats out of tradition, but they were called "Dixiecrats" to distinguish them from progressive Northern Democrats in the FDR mold. Lyndon Johnson was a Texas Dixiecrat and known bigot who nevertheless nurtured and signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which killed Jim Crow, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which largely ended black voter disenfranchisement, primarily in the South. After 1964 and particularly after Lee Atwater's Southern Strategy got Reagan elected, Dixiecrats switched their party loyalty to Republican. Today their are very few Democrats in Southern state government.  Your revisionist history is garbage, crafted to lure the ignorant toward racial hatred by making progressivism out to be evil. You are on the side of bigotry.

eng_test_1296	I've read most of what has been said regarding this issue from several different sources, and I've watched Seavy's video. I can't say with any certainty who did or didn't do what. But the one thing that stands out to me is how much effort Seavy seems to put towards possible theories as to how it could have happened, blaming anything and everything and especially the ITC. It's just an observation, but it seems to me like he's trying too hard. To me he might be a little more believable if he would check his disdain for the ITC at the door instead of making it the cornerstone for his defense.
eng_test_1297	Then you have obedience, not faith.
eng_test_1298	Hire a lawyer to explain the law to you. She's only going to prison because she killed someone, not for the DUI alone, which is not a felony. "Deadly piece of metal"? You must wonder why cars are legal and why they are not considered by law a deadly weapon, per se. What's the fatality rate of DUI drivers at the minimum BAL? It's virtually zero. This woman is a careless, self-absorbed idiot, which goes furthest in explaining her crime.
eng_test_1299	I get that his complaint was peevish, inconsiderate, and generally uncouth. That doesn't justify a rude email from a public servant. If you work in a public role, you're expected to be professional and civil, especially in the face of rank stupidity. If you can't do that, don't work for the public. How hard is it, really, to just say "I'm sorry sir but this service greatly assists us in saving  lives and we cannot exclude individuals from the list."?  Responding to childish behavior with childish behavior is, well, childish.
eng_test_1300	At least until next election
eng_test_1301	Another idiotic defense of the indefensible by the the revisionist "historian" bought and paid by the Alt-Right aptly named "non-Think Tank" propaganda machine to fill the national media with blatantly false Republican CONservative Fascist ideological bilge.  Time to put this nut out to pasture and remove him from his currently easy access to national media.

eng_test_1303	The real problem is not corporate elites rather "progressive elites" such as Trudeau and Wynne who are driving this country into the ground with uncontrolled spending, deficits, increased taxes (of all types) and energy/electricity costs. Their  vision has failed. I am tired of hearing that the progressives want to help middle class Canadians - how about changing the story to helping ALL Canadians. Our governments are falling short on all measures.
eng_test_1304	Conservatives tend to be long on Faith and short on facts. If a claim fits their faith they don't any facts to believe it. Bringing facts to the discussion can actually backfire, reinforcing Faith Based beliefs.  It wasn't that long ago that they claimed that every copy of a Bill Nye episode had somehow been edited with an anti Alt Right bias. As if you could somehow go out and edit every DVD copy ever made. The Religious Alt Right ate up that Fake News report.  https://www.snopes.com/bill-nye-gender-chromosomes/  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-convince-someone-when-facts-fail/
eng_test_1305	Disagree.  State employees don't "deserve" anything.  In particular, 50% of them don't deserve jobs when the money that used to be available to pay them is gone.  You don't here the thousands of folks laid off from the oil industry crying that they "deserve" their jobs.  Wake up to the economics, and send out the pink slips!

eng_test_1311	As a server in Portland for over 20 years I can say this concept frightens me. I've raised my son as a single mom on my income, comprised largely of tips. And that isn't to say we have lived in the lap of luxury! We've still had to get food stamps and other services at times over the years. But it's been a living, and I've worked! Very hard! to develop a skill set that earns me decent tips. Never once in this industry have I ever been given a raise unless minimum went up. Now if you tell me my tips are going to be absorbed by the owners and redistributed as they see fit, I wonder why I , or any other server worth their salt would want to do that job? Am I getting a raise to 16 dollars an hour? And the argument of cooks and other BOH staff not making enough doesn't move me either. Every job I've worked I've tipped out to support staff, who make more than I do hourly, and get raises. Plus, they don't want to work with the public! FOH earns tips by servicing customers... it's not easy!

Some months you really score big and other months they focus on another part of your hobby that you're not really into, so you're stuck with a box of stuff you'll never use (of course the value and quality of the goods are still high, so you're not getting ripped off).  It's normally a good deal, and it's always nice to be pleasantly surprised once a month.

Kim is not suicidal, but he will react with all the weapons at his disposal if trump were to do something stupid.  As I said, war is not inevitable unless diplomacy fails, and we owe it to the rest of the world to make the effort.  Impatience for a resolution is not an excuse for macho recklessness.

There is a 18 year old Latino Boy and his  Latino family that live  next to them that are, unauthorized immigrants.  Guess what, , the Latino boy is a sperm donor to the Mexican girl and she just gave birth.  They are not married, and he is around maybe 1 day a week, and he is not working.      The Mexican girl is bragging to the other neighbors about how much she gets each month in  FOOD STAMPS,  AND,  WELFARE  because she now has a child.    As the fleas suck the blood out of the dog, the ILLEGAL or UNAUTHORIZED immigrants are doing the same to our financial resources.    GO DONALD, DEPORT and BUILD THE WALL.................

eng_test_1329	Trump adopted the phrase 'America First' because it was an old racist Nazi buzzword from years ago. It was a dog-whistle siren call to his white supremacist brethren. Then Bannon spewed out some word salad for Trump to further butcher in an attempt to deny it. They came up with the empty 'isolationism' that Trump immediately denied when he met with Merkel. Trump never had any foreign policy, other than looking to skim money wherever he could. He's got no comprehensive intelligent policy on immigration except to push his xenophobic racist ideas. He's a petty con man, not an actual reasoned or sane human being, he's a fraud. He's imbalanced, unfit for office. Now we have a weak and insecure, belligerent child who imagines himself a fascist saviour. He's no more than an egotistical juvenile buffoon. We need to remove him from the office, get him out of office now. And the courts should have heard the case before reinstating any part of Trump's illegal and immoral ban.

You, Sir ain't got no clue to the truth!   Trump not a racist, rofl!  "Don't freak out" you tell me!  No I ain't black, but I'm a woke white boy!  Don't blame me for you being blind!

eng_test_1340	The only way I could see an election in the next six months is if none of the MLAs put themselves up for speaker.  No business can start without a speaker and if none is chosen the precedent is to call another election.  I doubt this would happen as one party would get blamed for it so high stakes gamble, but in the 1908 election in Newfoundland that is what happened as you had a tie in seats and both parties for own advantage refused to put up a speaker so that is the one and only case I could see another election.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_General_Assembly_of_Newfoundland

A little bite or annoying flying insect is almost as irritating as a rodent that carries the plague, competes with livestock for previous grass, destroys pasture land, contributes to erosion and creates hazards for livestock, as well as creating dens that harbor rattlers. Which are also a valuable part of the ecosystem but come with their own co-habitation issues. Of course if you aren't directly affected by any of that it's easy to roll your eyes, showing your superiority to the dumb hicks that make their living off the land.

eng_test_1366	Well Denise, winter can be a downer if you spend it looking out the window at it and only driving your car to and from your office and to the grocery store.  You are right. There are some serious concerns about global warming on the horizon and also about the state of the economy and the world. And with the President elect we have to wonder what this world is coming to.   The point about winter is that despite the negative effects of it, you have to stay positive and look for the good parts of it to enjoy. These include the winter sports that Canada is famous for. So is getting out for a nice walk that informs one that the cold and the snow isn't so bad once you acclimatize to it and accept it for what it is.  It becomes just another season that has it's conditions and requirements that one needs to adjust to. Just like politics. We take the good with the bad and deal with what political winds that blow our way.  I like to focus on the positive and deal with what is in front of me. :)
eng_test_1367	I'm disappointed with seeing Laurence go.  He first and foremost fixed customer service and brought in roam like home - what a great marketing name and idea!  Now the new guy Natale says he wants to improve customer service. Huh?  Look how poorly Telus is now doing and there's your answer. Laurence fixed the # 1 issue that faces large companies and that's collaboration between silo-like departments.  Congrats Rogers kids, you sure know how to pick'em.  I suppose it doesn't matter who gets the top job in a telecom oligopoly. Rogers is like Amazon with stacked ranking for its employees. Telus on the otherhand is a country club much like Microsoft. It'll be entertaining watching the Rogers stock slide and Natale be the next one to go.

eng_test_1379	You want a lesson in reality?  Justin's plan is just a page out of the old communist handbook. He has admitted his affection for both China and Cuba and the advantages of the Chinese form of government. Just like great communist before him he pits the working class against the rich. Standard fair for communist wannabees. In 1848, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels published the Communist Manifesto, which called on workers of the world, or the proletariat (JUSTIN'S SO CALLED MIDDLE CLASS), to unite against the bourgeoisie (HIS SO CALLED ONE PERCENTS) , the rich and powerful at the expense of the workers. Marx understood that communism could arise in countries with these two classes present if polarised properly. Justin and Butt's also understand this, they are using the same strategy to cloud the their real agenda. Because of this ideology how much they tax us is secondary to advancing their new Utopian view of Canadian politics. They don't care about us...just the cause.

Presto, BP makes millions more than they would if they'd just simply maintained its existing ownership of the building.

The bus ride to the job center takes an hour and a half? Boo...HOO. If you're unemployed, you have a lot of time on your hands, and your number one priority should be to get a job. Get on the bus. Less reliable, consistent internet access? I call BS. Every few minutes during my commute to and from work, MOST of the homeless I see holding signs also have smart phones.

When he goes on about fairness and then this comes out he looks silly. If he would have left everything the same and this came out, not quite the same reaction.  Either way justin is a clown. Cheers

eng_test_1407	The fact that the Orange Geezer has categorically denied that this could possibly be true, without any basis for knowing one way or the other, is highly suspicious. How could it possibly be to his advantage to deny the link? The claim, all along, was not that the Russians won the election for him. The claim was always only that the Russians hacked and meddled in the election.   The fact that the geezer's camp desperately wants this to go away suggests that they have something to hide and/or that they are completely insecure and paranoid about the validity of the election. Time will tell which of these is the case. Either way, Trump is looking like a chump and a fool.
eng_test_1408	Has any Democrat denounced or repudiate Hillary in the strongest terms possible because she lied about her handling of national security?

It amazes me how some can be so outraged about a stupid comment by the Trumpster and then lose their moral compass and common sense when it comes to Hillary.  Trump is bad, Hillary is worse.

eng_test_1412	At least he's got something to fall back on. What a relief.
eng_test_1413	LW1 - You are overthinking it. If she wants to post pictures that aren't her and pretend they are there's a simple thing you can do. Scroll past them. Don't react. Don't comment. Don't engage. It's her life, it's her social media account, and it's really none of your business.
eng_test_1414	Damn near all congressmen should be ousted. There are a few good ones, such as Gowdy, Cruz, Lee, and a few others, but the majority should be gone. That includes their leaders, and maybe they should lead the way.
eng_test_1415	"CKNW reported Guichon donated money to BC Liberals..."  Then, we read, "The media need to report she gave money and support to the BC Liberals..."  What?  CKNW doesn't rate as "media" any more?  I know the station's ratings have plummeted in recent years (wow: remember the era of the "Top Dog In BC Radio"?) but surely it still counts as "media."
eng_test_1416	What an inciting pile of trash including the website. You're dangerous and need to be monitored. And I'll keep posting this til the cows come home. Flag me again, I'm ready.
eng_test_1417	No!   The shooters are to blame for the murder of his mother.   That has got to be the pinnacle of victim blaming idiocy.   SMFH
eng_test_1418	And this will only make it worse.  Thanks for making my point Nemo.   It was way over RC's head.  And Mexico is no small market.  Way to go Trump!  You keep sucking up to Putin though....

eng_test_1428	No problem. I've done that too.
eng_test_1429	hey idiot we pay far more in taxes for all those things in the public sector, its the OVER taxation we are being taken for over and over and over that you ignorant left wingers cant live without
eng_test_1430	OldB, I'm afraid it's (b). Trump has rendered the Grand Old Party more spineless than grand, patriotism no match for personal profit.
eng_test_1431	Re: "We need to wait to see the details of what Trump proposes"  ???  So, among his many 'proposals', this idiocy isn't enough for you?
eng_test_1432	are you trying to justify your high school drop outs (temporary foreign workers) that can't read a damn map?  Try your BS elsewhere. I have a career, and know how the real world works and your corruption will NOT continue.
eng_test_1433	Yup. They could cover that ass-hat clinton all day long, but won't. Yellow journalism at best. Pathetic that this is the only rag in town.
eng_test_1434	No sober second thought for this silly woman. Sometimes it is better to say nothing at all rather than open your mouth and prove to the world how truly insensitive you are.
eng_test_1435	EPIC???? epically stagnant.  You're a hoot
eng_test_1436	The fact is that your juvenile president is really at home amongst other youngsters. Haven't you noticed that Barron is strangely absent and when he is he acts like the older brother to the idiot in chief. We are so f----ed up
eng_test_1437	The $26 billion will gone in 7 years, if you spend $3.5 billion a year.   Then what? Taxes?
eng_test_1438	It would be nice if we could have more discussion of how various tax and spending proposals effect the economy and less about the character or lack of same of Ms. Clinton and Mr. Trump.  Nothing wrong with Professor Blakeley weighing in on his perspectives, but more columns on the substance of how the US will fair depending on whose policies are adopted would be nice.   As a libertarian I want a fiscally conservative president like Gary Johnson and Bill Weld have proved to be as governors. Unfortunately the media doesn't seem to understand fiscal policy or simply feels it will bore their audience.
eng_test_1439	Over and above anything else, the oil must be kept in the ground (sands, whatever.)  It's time to look forward, not backward.  Our money must be spent on research and development in sustainable, clean energy sources.  Alberta, it is time to suck that up.  Get onto a new track, and work for the future sustainability of the planet.
eng_test_1440	That would be Stalin, you big history buff, you.

eng_test_1443	More irrational garbage and hysterical hyperbole from the left, the insanity of the left has become far more dangerous to humanity with their unfounded Boogie Man Nuclear Nightmares.
eng_test_1444	This may indicate a change in Russia-US relations, as EXXON was doing quite a good business over there, before Obama came up with his idiotic sanctions     ;))
eng_test_1445	Fabulous.   "Police dubbed Lee a "serial rapist."  Seriously? Why is this is quotes? I would say that this maggot is definitely a serial rapist.   ADN.  Over 95% of your articles regarding rapes, assault and sexual predation have NO PHOTO. For the love of God! If these were all random stranger rapes, ya think that would be the first thing you would include with the story!! Your own article says it's a serial rapist, stranger attacks, and dates back to at least 2001. How would any other victim be able to come forward without a photo? This guy needs to be in jail for life. And not in segregation. Needs a frequent taste of his own medicine. Why sexual predators get special treatment in jail to try to prevent them from being raped is ludicrous and beyond belief. Mark them as sex offenders and put them in general pop.
eng_test_1446	Talk about "strawmen."  Do you really think the average sheriff's deputy or policeman is "undertrained and immature" compared to the average CC civilian?  For shame.
eng_test_1447	Another scared-brainless poster, ready to "preventatively" nuke 25 million people out of FEAR.  Pathetic.  Remember when we were the Home of the Brave?  Danged right-wing COWARDS...
eng_test_1448	Either you are a helpless partisan, or dumb as a rock....  Most likely the latter...
eng_test_1449	Actually I do find Harvey and his actions disgusting, what about you and the list of abuses trump has committed, including raping his ex-wife.  Outraged or OK because it's your parties incompetent president?
eng_test_1450	If you have evidence of this alleged hacking, you are the only one.  Share!
eng_test_1451	FYI:  Research both judgement and judgment, takes approx. 30 seconds.   They are BOTH equally accepted nowadays.
eng_test_1452	Thank you for concern.  No, I have not yet shared your experience.
eng_test_1453	What a garbage human. Maybe FCC should screen for anger problems? This guy can't use a firearm responsibly and has no authority to hold people at gunpoint like that.
eng_test_1454	Stupid article about a false past.
eng_test_1455	WTF does Trump have to do with this?
eng_test_1456	Donald going to eat you up and spit you out without missing a beat.
eng_test_1457	Jacob Zuma got to his position of easy rape and refined abuse of all South Africa with the complicit agreement of Business Leaders in South Africa.   It is possible that by virtue of mere education these contemptible boards and directors could think outside the corporate box and become part of the soul of this land; they could actually rehumanize and give a shit.   Surprise us why don't you?
eng_test_1458	incompetent ignorant fools......spending money for shit.  get rid of cap and trade, reduce hydro not spend frivolously like a bunch of bafoons.  So negligent.
eng_test_1459	No, didn't you notice that people are becoming dumber and dumber today due to technology ?  He thought he could use his money to destroy her because he was "outraged" like the rest of the sheeple do these days on the internet.  These two must be millennials.  In fact, I am sure they are.
eng_test_1460	No pervert like a religious pervert.  Does this ordained Pentecostal pastor actually preach somewhere?  Former PM Harper sure had a slew of sexual predators around him and owing him favours - from a pedophile drummer to various political appointees, including this senator.
eng_test_1461	So, the proposal is to take $215 billion ($215,000,000,000), most of it from Medicare and individual policy aid while allowing states to deny coverage for preexisting conditions, only to give the wealthiest another big, fat tax cut.  Yes sir, folks, just the ticket to make America great again!
eng_test_1462	I am a retired civil engineer with over 40 years of experience; whereas you are a troll
eng_test_1463	Well, I guess that says it all!
eng_test_1464	The calculations are not really equivalent, given that you have $5,000 let idle - $6,000 if you get a $1,000 bonus. Put that against the $7,290 mortgage insurance up front, so the part owing and rolled into the mortgage is only $1,290,  and what would the payments be?
eng_test_1465	psst hey loser, the act of damage was  VIOLENCE hence an act designed to INTIMIDATE society for a POLITICAL agenda. thus it was TERRORISM! man you leftards and dumb
eng_test_1466	Let's turn the tables for a moment.  Suppose you have standing to be a plaintiff in a case that restricts abortion. You go to the ACLU- who is in the business of civil rights litigation- and demand they represent you in a case that, if upheld, will restrict abortion.  Would they take your case?  Of course not. It conflicts with their beliefs. So why is this different for a baker?  Well, because as a plaintiff you have more than an arm's length transaction. You will probably deposit a retainer. You will sign a representation agreement. And so on.  You would be a CLIENT. Businesses refuse clients all the time. By taking a deposit for a specific cake for a specific customer for a specific ceremony for a specific day, the baker is taking on a CLIENT. That is materially different than a customer pulling a cupcake off the shelf.  I hope the courts are able to make this distinction.
eng_test_1467	His love, yes; mercy; no--for then there would be universal salvation.
eng_test_1468	Welcome to the New Apprentice - White House Style!
eng_test_1469	Gurriel lost people's respect. By the way, I am reinforcing what you state in your least sentence, just from a different angle. If he is sorry for being a goof and doing something I learned was wrong in Grade 5, then good for him. That is the hope, but there is no reason not to slap him down right now.
eng_test_1470	The legal profession is cleaner with Arnold leaving it and the pot growing business is scummier with his arrival.
eng_test_1471	Then there are political rallies,  such as  will be held by Trump this weekend in Florida.  The sheep can be expected to take to the field and gobble up der Orangeführer's pronouncements and attacks upon "the enemy of he people". Let's party like it's 1933!
eng_test_1472	Learn the nature of proof, and you can start doing that by getting your GED. Proof is not the absence of proof suggesting the contrary. You're a stone-cold cretin.

eng_test_1474	Only the government can be so dumb on a large scale, thanks Pres. Trump.
eng_test_1475	A "cry from the white nationalist gut"? What a complete load of utter horses**t. What the h*ll is wrong with the left that it has to inject race into everything?
eng_test_1476	Not enough that no one cares what you or the seven faces of eve post, but now trying to sucker punch your way in a leaf thread. Beleive me this will be my last reply, good day to you
eng_test_1477	Funny how a column about Trump and Mexico turns into an opportunity to blame our PM. Some of the commenters here need to see a shrink to treat their obsession.
eng_test_1478	Boy, all the UH teams are not very good this year....

eng_test_1483	Not sure if this is the location, but I think Alaska needs a organic grave yard. Possible options 1) The use of organic pods 2) Straight burial without coffin 3) Combination.  Use limited markers on surface.  Maybe live flowers or trees.  Current burials are below the decomposition level and offer little to the organic balance.  Coffins require a lot of materials and energy to make and may never decompose. This would be a lower cost and possibly better sand to sand story.  Have to retrain all of us on the value of current traditional burials.
eng_test_1484	what's with the damn kiddy cowboy hats?? She is one sick bitch.
eng_test_1485	Scientists have been predicting climate change for longer than 30 years. It came true - like science often does.  I get the feeling you have a point to make but are incapable of expressing it in English.
eng_test_1486	The left? What if it was a guy that was somewhere between Richard Spencer and Mussolin on the political spectrum?  Do you understand what the story is about? They usually sum it up in the headline, at the top. Journalism, how does it work?  Do you want to talk about how a guy was dumb enough to walk into a bunch of young and dumb anti-Nazis wearing a swastika shirt? Alright, fire away.
eng_test_1487	The far right complains, complains, complains. "People are stupid." "The press is against us." And on it goes. The fact is, people are usually smart enough to reject simplistic, selfish,  right-wing fantasies of "cut taxes and paradise will come."
eng_test_1488	Show me the rule or rules that permit to happen with SB128 that happened.  It never was reported out of that committee and that is a fact.   I can show you where that action is not in accordance with Joint Uniform Rule 24.  You are entitled to your own opinion but not your own facts.
eng_test_1489	Pimienta is a racist.  Boycott this nasty witch.
eng_test_1490	Trump's corruption has nothing to do with Clinton, so how about you getting over it, and try basing your comment on the topic, which is the racist, sexist, narcissitic, incompetent Trump, who signs EOs without even knowing what they mean. And you still support him. SAD!
eng_test_1491	He should be making a statement to assure Canadians that he knows what is going on and is preparing for any scenario....and since that relates to the Korean situation it is a valid concern. US has a fool for a leader we have a child.
eng_test_1492	When was Nazi Germany part of Canada Brissy?  The sad little fact is that sometimes, sometimes, evil needs to be met on its own turf.  Luckily for some, other courageous people often offer to do the dirty work for the cowardly.
eng_test_1493	Really, what a ridiculous remark. Hateful speech has been the main stay of Right Wing media figures for years, going back to Rush Limbaugh. Let's not be blaming the 22 year olds.
eng_test_1494	Amazing and beautiful!
eng_test_1495	Okay, please show us ANY evidence produced by these FIVE separate investigations.
eng_test_1496	I like the outrageous  comments. It reveals the idiots.
eng_test_1497	Actually it is like they suddenly have to pay much higher taxes, why do you think people are so upset?  They weren't already paying 48% on that 'extra patient'.  That extra money was being saved for retirement in the corporation, and will be worth a far deal more when it is pulled out, presumably when the physician has a much lower overall income.    Now if there was a boost in RRSP space, then this disincentive could be offset.
eng_test_1498	Whereas pathologically lying Trump gets a pass, correct?  He's done nothing but lie from the instant he got in the race to the present. I thought all Republicans and right wingers supported Trump? If you support him you support his corruption, incessant lying, thievery and other well-known sociopathic traits demonstrating his lack of any sort of stability.    Pathetic.
eng_test_1499	Who the hell is John McCain? If the MSM and progressive liberals dropped this turncoat, no one in the GOP would shed a tear. Worst GOP candidate in living memory. Total useful idiot to opponents of President Trump. Nobody really likes McCain. Time for this POW to go home and drop the pretense. #FakeHero.
eng_test_1500	Even a dog will bite it's abuser. Sorry NFL you kick us we bite back
eng_test_1501	The real instigators are Democrats and Liberals! That's the Un-Americans for you! Democrats teaches Racism and Hate against the White Man every chance they get! Liberals, Milinnials will riot to stop short an orators point of view. SAD! Un-Americans! Home Grown Terrorists spewin racism, hate and controlled speech!
eng_test_1502	Ms. Crawford, Alaska got the representation for which it voted.  Our state legislature is a reflection of our U.S. Congress under Trump.  Until Alaskans and Americans pull their heads out of their hind ends and clean the crap out of their eyes, this is going to keep happening.   I'm done puzzling over how anyone could be stupid enough to vote these folks in. The only thing I know for sure is that they keep doing it time and time again.   You can't fix stupid.
eng_test_1503	If we had a normal government yes but we have a bunch a crooks running the show who stop at nothing to get there way. The only recourse civil society has is to demand  a secret ballot and to go to the courts.  How people can write such blatant lies and hypocrisy ?
eng_test_1504	I say it's high time the G&M got rid of this pompous so called columnist full of sour grapes who continues to write nonsense.  Get over it: Trump won and we'll have at least four years of him.  Let's move on.  This whining based on expectations of the doomsday scenario is nauseating!
eng_test_1505	You're an pretentious racist punk.
eng_test_1506	You are so far out there.....
eng_test_1507	More dull-witted label mongering nonsense.
eng_test_1508	That sound really nuts, Phil. Stop reading trash on the internet, and stop listening to people on AM radio who sell soap by appealing to the suckers among us.
eng_test_1509	What a trite ignorant letter that repeats the latest arguments from conservative Republicans against any form of protest. They call the youth of our country brain-washed because they don't agree with their reactionary viewpoints. I wonder which is the party that is brainwashed in this discussion.
eng_test_1510	The President is insane.  Obviously.  He should be removed from office.
eng_test_1511	Campaigning 24/7 has become more of a priority than governing to these political parties.  Canada is suffering from this kind of manipulation of our democratic processes.  Political parties are destroying democracy in Canada and Canadians need to take control of how they are run or demand to get rid of them all together.  Independent MPs would be more concerned about their constituents than the party line. This infighting could be brought to a halt.     Elections should be paid for in full by tax payers.  Every candidate gets a set amount of dollars to level the playing field and stop the political donation rebates all together.  That would mitigate the power political parties have over our electoral system.
eng_test_1512	Why get married in the first place if there is so little trust at the outset?  And the non-repayable part, after the marriage either lasts to a milestone, or after the parents who gave die...the fastest growing category of divorces (according to this paper) are the mid-late life ones..  So two people get married in their 20's, get a big gift from one side, and then divorce 30 years later, after being married for a long time, as well as seeing the "givers" die...the undeserving spouse you were so worried about "wins" anyway...  You cannot control the future..
eng_test_1513	The malignant narcissist and mentally deficient sociopath is not only a bigot, a racist, a closet fascist and a draft-dodging warmonger. He is a blustering pathological liar without shame, disingenuous, dishonest, divisive, immoral, incompetent, inept, unethical, unstable, untrustworthy, and unfit. His stupid, intemperate remarks precisely define his personality. This wannabe president has no idea of how to represent this country, domestically or internationally, and is viewed poorly by members of his own party, as well asby many foreign leaders.    What may be even more contemptible are the GOP sycophants and boot licks in his administration and Congress who allow this pathetic charade to continue, and his glassy-eyed fans who believe he can do no wrong. The sooner this dishonorable political degenerate is out, the sooner the country can recover from his foul stain on our history.   We are living in a kakistocracy. Look it up. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakistocracy
eng_test_1514	As you point out, no president has been perfect and they've all had weaknesses and limitations. But Trump stands alone. Have him stand next to any one of our prior presidents and there is no comparison other than monstrous aberration.
eng_test_1515	And, in news being reported in the UK, but not in this paper (at least on on the front of the electronic edition), one of the papers released reveals an anonymous call that was made to someone at a newspaper in the UK that seemed to hint at the assassination right before it happened.   It was reported to the security agencies given other similar cases.  This was reported on newswires at least 10 hours ago.
eng_test_1516	Yes one year in office and the Liberals are back to their tricks, is anybody surprised!!!!!. Trudeau has lied to Canadians, broken countless promises and has openly admitted to breaking our laws. Not only is Trudeau the first prime minister in Canadian history to ever be under investigation by the conflict-of-interest and ethics commissioner for breaking our federal laws but he's also under investigation by the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages.  He managed to get away with physically shoving around a female politician in the House of Commons and for breaking our immigration laws by not deporting Monsef for illegally entering Canada under a falsified application after deporting hundreds of others for the exact same reason. Truly the truth is the Liberals biggest enemy, if Trudeau had a shred of moral integrity  he would step down.
eng_test_1517	scuppers.. Facts and reality won't help your case. You'll need to get into the gutter with false facts, false accusations mixed in with conspiracy and delusion to get the conservatives to do what their going to do anyway and that is vote for Trump and look away in shame when they confront their wifes and daughters on how they could vote for such a slob.
eng_test_1518	Trump is a national disgrace and a global embarrassment. A common criminal. A liar on a grand scale. A sexual predator. The first order of business if he is elected is impeachment. And years of investigations.

eng_test_1523	That's why so many things are called 'theories' in science.  I can 'believe' that the earth is flat as millions and millions of people did and would have testified to for centuries.  It was also verified by the theologians.  That did not make it so.  Millions and millions of people believe in astrology. (Mrs. Reagan?) Does that 'belief' overcome science just because millions 'believe' it? How about 'alchemy'? Can lead yet be turned into gold? You have not achieved Reductio ad absurdum "which seeks to demonstrate that a statement is true by showing that a false, untenable, or absurd result follows from its denial". You have merely made an absurd argument.  My response was just killed as well, so here it is again.  1st Re-post

eng_test_1532	Yawn. Ten investigations. No negligence found. Face it, you can go after the Clintons all you want but your decades of striving have only uncovered one blowjob and a few emails.  You have nothing on the Clintons.
eng_test_1533	"Intionally shot the dog and truly did threaten his wife unprovoked with a weapon"? Maybe he accidentally shot the dog by pointing the weapon and pulling the trigger, but didn't mean the dog harm. Maybe his stupid, nagging, clingy wife provoked him by burning the toast or not replenishing his beer. We don't know the whole story here and the man probably deserves a pat on the back for showing restraint for as long as he has.
eng_test_1534	Why any country would allow foreigners to buy real estate in any form is beyond me.  It can only inflate real costs while adding no value.  So it is nice to see the 9% of demand being discussed but the additional 80%+ demand for additional new housing units due to mass immigration is never mentioned.  Surely demand is a prime driver in inflated housing costs so all demand, particularly the largest sources should be on the table in the national conversation.  Cheers, John Meyer
eng_test_1535	Thanks mocanic, moving the problem to another area is not the answer, besides that place has had the hell shot out of it and several fires set, trash dumped, moose calves shot and butchered, people shooting on the road at grouse to name a few.  The answer is showing some responsibility when handling a firearm.
eng_test_1536	J-Lee dragging in Trudeau's name was relevant Trudeau is about style over substance Much like universities - style (political correctness) trumps substance (academic scholarship) Universities have become centers for leftist social activists and not for scholars and when i say "activists" I include the faculty
eng_test_1537	L4: you're making a very definite statement, trying to excuse the cpc. I'd like to see the cpc make some definite statements itself.  To explain why they destroyed ballots far too quickly. To explain why the auditing firm weren't actually asked to properly audit the results (they say it wasn't in their contract).  And why did the cpc make it impossible to verify which candidates signed up which members? They found  many fake sign-ups but they just didn't want to know who did it?  The only transparency the cpc shows is in their gross incompetence.

eng_test_1539	Omar Khadr is an admitted terrorist who killed a battlefield medic.  He deserves nothing but repugnance from Canadians.  The $10.5 payout to a man who made bombs to kill our soldiers will stick to Mr. Trudeau and the Liberals like a bad smell.

eng_test_1551	"The Crown Prince of Bahrain, who had donated to the foundation, wanted to meet with Clinton on a visit to Washington. Abedin responded to Band that the Bahrainis had already made that request through normal diplomatic channels. The two did end up meeting."  SCANDALOUS!
eng_test_1552	I had to disapprove several comments just to be able to post the above, and this comment. CC idiots!
eng_test_1553	Yes, heaven forbid your child comes into contact with a brown/black skinned person.
eng_test_1554	Today Trump tried and spectacularly failed to defend himself,    and the best part was where he threw the rest of his campaign under the bus.  He's such a weak and mentally unstable buffoon.  Sad.
eng_test_1555	That bastard, Eddie Lampert, should be drawn and quartered!  My spouse will soon lose the pension he worked damn hard for.  Also, Sears Registered Retirement Plan was mandatory. We've just simply lost faith in everything.
eng_test_1556	Especially keep your religion out of the halls of Congress. What in the world were Kelly and the other "christians" doing injecting their religious beliefs onto the floor of the state legislature? Would they have welcomed a Muslim or a Hindu or even a Jew to comment on their religious distortions on the floor of the Senate? Just do your damned jobs and get the financial mess straightened out. And Jesus ain't gonna be any help in that department either.
eng_test_1557	who gives a shit what tis arrogant jew thinks about anything.  What good did he do  for NYC?
eng_test_1558	Hopefully, whoever was running this "ed-venture" chastised the idiot for harassing the goat.  Another example of human stupidity in the face of pure grace and beauty.
eng_test_1559	Nothing was more important to Jesus Christ than treating disfavored minorities like s**t.
eng_test_1560	I explained exactly why you are an ignorant fool who has absolutely no idea what you are talking about. You just proved my point all the more as you are incapable of refuting anything I referenced exposing your ignorance.  talk about snarky jerks and windbags, you called out a county commissioner running your mouth like a snarky windbag jerk, pawning off pure ignorant stupidity as fact. Like a coward you will not address the facts I referenced, and as usual post something more fit for a public bathroom wall.
eng_test_1561	Adios, sociopath!
eng_test_1562	A couple dozen people is NOT "The Peninsula". It's just a couple dozen people. And if they want to they can send all their money to these countries we've been paying for. We're not going to stand by anymore and pay billions while China and India are allowed to pollute at will, expand their coal use and pretend to be part of this silly 'accord'. There is no accord. How is the smog in Beijing today?  I would suggest these 40 old fogies take their little drums and signs to Beijing and make a difference. For the children.
eng_test_1563	I'm amazed that you taught children with that dirty, foul mouth of yours... ADN should cancel you.    You're disgusting.
eng_test_1564	As usual it's all about money and political power, everyone wants it, but more importantly everyone wants to make sure no one else gets it.  A revered elder once explained the local mentality regarding money and power to me with a parable.  Kamehameha the Great was once attempting to arbitrate a dispute between two self important Kahunas. The dispute was over a trivial matter that had become an ego contest.  In an effort to expeditiously resolve the matter Kamehameha offered to grant the more senior of the two anything he wished, with the condition that his rival get twice what he was given.  Without a moments hesitation the older Kahuna said "put out one of my eyes".  Based on the recent decision by the PUC, some things never change...
eng_test_1565	Last thing I want to hear ..is crap rap...while I'm walking thru the fair grounds with my grand kids...keep crap rap where it belongs ..in sleazy bars and night clubs..

eng_test_1569	"Repurchasing shares boosts earnings per share by reducing the shares remaining on the market. Critics contend the money can be better used to hire employees or buy equipment."  ................ Why don't those critics hire employees or buy equipment ?
eng_test_1570	and none of them have a carbon tax you ignorant idiot
eng_test_1571	OT62502 is correct. If you're going to tax the 'investment' in lottery tickets when they pay off, you must also allow any losses on lottery tickets to lower taxable income. And as more money is lost at the lottery than won...
eng_test_1572	OK Bill.  Now that you know we don't much like your taking advantage of a loophole will you kindly deposit your assets in a blind trust and end the distraction?
eng_test_1573	I find it hard to believe that the need for on-site security was "unexpected." This is sad news though.
eng_test_1574	Any destruction of Alaska's Grand Nature by the oil n gas industry means the industry needs higher standards.  The state needs to be the state (tax, regulate, oversight) and quit trying to be a partner.  Public/private partnerships are stupid.  Good read!
eng_test_1575	You don't count. Freddy, the arrogant, pompous donkey can attack with impunity, but is critical of anyone who posts an opposing or differing view.
eng_test_1576	Oh garbage! There are no Russian Boogiemen hiding in the bushes.
eng_test_1577	There's a third option: they're just plain stupid. I believe that covers about 90% of those types of postings.
eng_test_1578	Damnit!, I was going to Pearson airport Thursday morning to have my bag handled. Well that sucks!!........Hmmmm, maybe.
eng_test_1579	First of all, where is the profit and political gain?    It is not the job of local jurisdictions to enforce federal law, it only puts an extra burden on local law enforcement.  It is an unfunded mandate from the from the so called President.  Also it needs to be noted that it is not the undocumented immigrants that put us in danger, read the statistics.
eng_test_1580	Just think how much smarter and better looking than you she is. That's the true reason you feminazis hate her. You are all a bunch of nasty hags,, angry and weird.
eng_test_1581	I'm hardly apologizing for fascists. I'm just recognizing that there are kooks on both sides who need to get their heads screwed on. Last time I checked you can believe what you want in this country, no matter how how stupid. If you're a white supremist you're an idiot, if you believe in equality of outcome vs. equality of opportunity you're also an idiot. I get that there's plenty of idiots out there, not all equal.
eng_test_1582	Where is the sexual assault? Bill Clinton holds that record. Hillary had a little something to do with that to. Trump was chasing tail, nobody was crying foul. America has their heads in there ass, reads newspapers around the world.
eng_test_1583	I hope you Republican cowards can see that this is what scares you so much.  A grandmother.  What made Republicans such pathetic cowards?
eng_test_1584	The next person who gets killed should be skinned and the meat salvaged for charity. That will make everything ok.
eng_test_1585	More like "a boatload of idiots"!
eng_test_1586	I do not see us winning 12 games this year, and honestly after the first 4 games if we're 2-2 that's not a bad start with this schedule.  After the bye, we get the Giants at home, followed by Chargers, Chiefs and Eagles on the road, and then the Pats back home.  Not saying the Broncos can't win those games, but no matter who is QB, this is a tough tough schedule, so I don't know where you are seeing 12 wins.
eng_test_1587	Securitas Security Guards with guns ?  Very Scary !!  Very irresponsible for the couple to leave the dog as they did at the airport of all places. The owner is responsible for this incident to have occurred. The owners story about the dog being secured is suspect.
eng_test_1588	No, as you know, I didn't confuse anything. This is the way the government of the United States and most (probably all) of the states compute a criminal sentence.  Serious question:  What are you getting out of this?  I don't think anyone who has read your posts here thinks you're stupid.  I don't think you are.  Why are you pretending to be?  You're making yourself look like an idiot, and I'm honestly curious about why you are doing it.
eng_test_1589	I wonder why?  Answer:  Because AIPAC likes it when they bomb Muslims.
eng_test_1590	Why do Hick and the Dems hate brown-skinned people?  They're nothing but disgusting Nativists and racists.
eng_test_1591	I'm sure those were the intentions the first time round.
eng_test_1592	One must muse how the Globe has shut down the comment section regarding the  attacks in Quebec! The National Post is permitting health, mature debate.  When will the Globe treat its readers with the same level of respect??? Free speech should never be blocked even if your hear things that might be personally offensive.
eng_test_1593	He's an idiot pandering to Trump's base, otherwise he would have told the whole truth.  Instead he lied by omission. No surprise.
eng_test_1594	Every where the Muslims go they make trouble.They think every one that doesn't agree with their pedophile Mohammed is not worthy.Maybe they should try to assimilate to their new home and quit being whiny assholes for once
eng_test_1595	STFU you political schill, disgrace.
eng_test_1596	I see you hold some opinions to which you are allowed to maintain....hopefully you're able bodied and minded for the rest of your days and never find yourself vulnerable and at the mercy of others who may make similar judgements.  My question is really less opinion seeking than that of genuine curiosity ...do we as a community have a program in place once temperatures drop below a certain number to rescue people. There are some who may want their independent space at 15 degrees....but at 20 below, might have a different perspective.
eng_test_1597	Oh boy....  No obvious fuel storage.   No visible structure for landing gear.    Wings the size of a hang glider yet it will lift 4 engines, the fuel (assuming Charles wants to include fuel), the landing gear (assuming Charles wants this to be able to land and take off), controls, hydraulics, as well as the weight of the "pilot".  The Globe continues to call this "Prototypes".   They should call this column "Whimsy".    It IS supposed to be funny, right?
eng_test_1598	Utah? Are all you Hitlery acolytes that delusional? You have to be to support HRC, spawn of satan.
eng_test_1599	From the day this was proposed thousands of us knew is was one of the dumbest things our legislators had ever come up with. The corruption in our government isn't new, it's grown and thrived for decades, won't stop until the Democrats are ousted. When this boondoggle is said and done there will be many new people in the top 1% pushed their by the corruption of this project. Two legislators standing up to the massive corruption won't stop this piece of garbage but they get credit for having something that those supporting it don't have - BALLS!!
eng_test_1600	It's is probably more common than you realize having experience and still screwing up.  My ex was in the AF and his job was combat arms training and maintenance (CATM).  He was emptying out his gun one day, but got distracted.  He thought he had cleared his weapon and so he fired the gun pointing at the car.  The bullet ricocheted off the trunk and out the window in the direction of people standing outside.  One of his fellow CATM members once thought he had cleared his weapon and so pulled the trigger.  He was in his truck and I think he shot his radio.  You'd think an AF Cop would know how to drive, but one hit me on Elmendorf AFB causing $5k in damage.  Military can be very stupid too.
eng_test_1601	We have to ask ourselves, on Wednesday May, 10....did we really just go and give that corrupt government another four years?
eng_test_1602	I prefer racists to be scorned as you should be scorned for your racist views.  You and your racist fellow travelers aren't ever going to be part of any solution, don't even pretend that you might be.  Look to your own racism and the part that plays in this community.  It's not a welcome part you play.
eng_test_1603	I agree. Rex Tillerson is the only adult in the Trump Administration. I had hopes that General Kelly would be able to keep the Tweetmeister under control but he seems to ave lost that battle - if he doesn't resign, he's complicit inthe craziness of Trumpland.
eng_test_1604	I don't intend to watch the spectacle.  I have better things to do.  My mind was made up months ago.  Hillary is sleazy status quo.  Donald Trump is a psychopath.  Unfortunately I have to go with sleaze over insanity.    I'll leave it to the biased media to tell me who 'won'.
eng_test_1605	What about the people who were born here,screw foreign buyers.I,nor my kids,will ever be able to afford a house because wages are still in the dark ages and we are taxed to death.Now foreigners and shady real estate agents are destroying B.C,forever. .Start taking care of us,not them.God damn it!!!!!
eng_test_1606	Really? What other Civil beat articles have you commented on in the past month?
eng_test_1607	And Trump is just stupid enough to fall for it. Trump is a narcissistic, mentally unstable, incompetent egomaniac. And that's on one of his better days.
eng_test_1608	Except he served like a real Alaskan in the state legislature  for many years while the Repubarks were hijacking the process for BP/Conaco/Exon and passing out CBC hats, you more-on cracker
eng_test_1609	This court approved 3rd is crap they never watch the person who the hell has time to do that?? Why don't we have the death penialty?
eng_test_1610	I think it is now time to move out of this Socialist State and leave behind those representatives that claim they are looking out for our interests. Additionally, if you have ever watched those TV interviews of young people being asked simple questions concern history or for example "who is the Vice President or who fought in the revolutionary war?" The young people haven't a clue. Why, because they are not being taught the basics in school by the teachers who are never satisfied with what they make and that might be properly blamed on their union.
eng_test_1611	I'm looking for facts - not an editorial.
eng_test_1612	Station cops in the parking lot of shopping centers maybe underclothes ones. This kind of nonsense we get from these clowns. All acting like they give a shiit
eng_test_1613	Another soap opera to deflect attention from the real crisis facing Americans . A story posted in this paper. Delegates of both parties had their vites stripped and directed to these two candidates. You no longer matter
eng_test_1614	Here's an idea to APD and troopers. Get a suit and tie, just because an idiot eludes you and makes it to an apartment building doesn't require SWAT, all officers in tactical gear. All having AR weapons that you don't want us to have. I laughed my butt off when I saw that female police officer in her tactical gear... Priceless
eng_test_1615	For the rest of their lives I might add.
eng_test_1616	They did. They put out a statement August 30th telling everyone to be vigilant. They have brought in the FBI so that should tell a person with some amount of IQ to watch their ass.  and didja ever stop to think that maybe they are trying to keep it quiet is if there is one the person might go "underground" if they think the fuzz is getting close to capturing them? just food for thought.  p.s I think our police chief sucks and needs to be gone.
eng_test_1617	But the President doesn't ask for or appoint special prosecutors at the federal level. That is why Trumps remarks are outrageous. The FBI investigated her and found three [C] hidden in the last paragraphs of emails that were not classified properly in the heading.  That was it.
eng_test_1618	Comment deleting snowflakes, I repost. Losers.  There's about 2 million a year in fat, bloated salaries, arguing how to get more, while still maintaining the front that it's all about children.Teacher's unions, pfhooie. Enemies of the People. Union dues go  to further George Soros' plan to convert America to Islam. Traitors all, and their hero, Obama, is America's #1 cop killer. When we get around to actually draining this cesspool, don't forget these swamp rats.
eng_test_1619	Is tRump merely too stupid to understand that he is embroiled in a deep investigation and doesn't comprehend it, or is he deliberately telling his people to lie?
eng_test_1620	Janet is a caring "useful idiot", to use Stalin's term and in doing so is hurting Canada. She should be charged with aiding and abetting a criminal enterprise.
eng_test_1621	Let me,  You first. S**t before the shovel
eng_test_1622	That's where you are evading the real issues by trying to make this about psychology. It's stupid, a refusal to think, and the more you do it the less respect I have for any of your opinions.
eng_test_1623	Alanah Peterson deserves jail time just as much as her kids for raising dysfunctional members of society! Better parents less crime...
eng_test_1624	Respect and appreciation to our officers. ADN you are scum. Yellow journalism is out. Bunch of red diaper doper babies running the show here.
eng_test_1625	I hear from Trumps attorney;s that Trump is NOT under investigation. Maybe it's Comey and others. And it's said AGAIN on TV, on 8/3/2017.
eng_test_1626	The U.S national debt is 19 trillion + dollars.  That translates into about $165,00.00 per taxpayer.   The U.S. can't afford to continue this.  It sound like Germany has finally realized the reality of the situation,  as other would do well to do.
eng_test_1627	No, raising money for sick children given her close ties in events with her business associate father since his election raises the concern for the ethics being displayed-here usuing his elected office for personal gain.
eng_test_1628	We aren't California or New York .    You obviously don't pay the ever rising taxes, but I do and the personal  incomes in this town  don't support them and I'm sick of them being raised on a yearly basis to support the freeloaders and things like stupid and unneeded roundabouts so the current mayor can have some sort of legacy after he's booted out of office.
eng_test_1629	Here is some more fake blood Amber.....  http://www.ojjpac.org/memorial.asp  http://www.illegalaliencrimereport.com/
eng_test_1630	Wow took one look at her face then searched her name with feminist. Big suprise. Maybe if you take a break from shouting "I hate Trump" in the form of "journalism" people could stomach this Extreme Left crap. Its hard being liberal and having you people whine, cry and scream bigot while writing bigoted pieces.
eng_test_1631	Newsflash:  they aren't the brightest bulbs in the chandelier.  The first clue is how much the left wants the here.  The left likes losers.  That's their power base and it's all about power.  Know a few schoolteachers and privately they tell me how difficult it is to teach "Latinos".  That's because they are stupid.
eng_test_1632	How pathetic.  Now repubs lie and tell us that trump won the people's vote.  Is that you Hair Twitler?  "Most" of us voted for Hillary.  Quit pretending otherwise, liar.  I see that you changed your screen name once more.  Banned again, were you?
eng_test_1633	Fred, while I understand your hatred of anything Israeli, I do know that you are not devoid of accepting factual information. I fully agree that Israel attacked first, after the provocations I outlined above. Yes, they did claim that Egypt attacked first, then admitted that they had done a preemptive attack. However, The USS liberty was off the northern coast of the Sinai, about 25 nm NW of El Arish. That would put the Liberty about 175 miles SW of the Golan Heights. The technology of the time would have allowed the Liberty to monitor local theater communications, an area about 60 to 75 miles from their location but in no way would they have been able to intercept tactical communications anywhere close to the Golan Heights. The Syrians, falsely led to believe the Egyptians were winning huge, began an offensive against Israel on June 5th, using artillery and their Air Force along with a limited ground offensive. They failed miserably. The Liberty attack was on June 8th.
eng_test_1634	"These players aren't disrupting the playing of the National Anthem, the players aren't shouting, they're not interfering with the singer or the instrumental playing, they're kneeling silently. And I fail to see how taking a knee in silence is disrespectful." ========= I might tend to agree. They (or at least some) appear to be praying. And a lot of religious people will say that what our country needs is a lot more people doing a lot more praying......even if it is during the National Anthem.
eng_test_1635	Liberals are promoting stupid.  It gets them votes.
eng_test_1636	If this was a black issue you would also have black people in your family. Cut the crap, we can see right through it!
eng_test_1637	That is a very creative view.  No state, or the federal government has taken that view. Alexander Hamilton wrote in 1788: "If circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude, that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens." "A widespread fear, during the debates on ratifying the Constitution, was the possibility of a military takeover of the states by the federal government, which could happen if the Congress passed laws prohibiting states from arming citizens, or prohibiting citizens from arming themselves."
eng_test_1638	Pretty sharp comment, considering that I never mentioned any that Trump said, or if I think that he is a good candidate.  My comment was only about the bias in the media, including the articles that ADN has been running.  You will also notice that I clearly stated that Drudge is not an unbiased source; just a good one to compare to the likes of ADN.  I am able to see bias, point it out and even laugh at it when it is as over the top as in this case, regardless of my position on the issue.
eng_test_1639	Thanks for your superiority complex. There's not a lot you can do legally or medically  for a mentally ill adult.
eng_test_1640	So why again are we THE CITIZENS pating for Illegals again?. All immagrants i know pay there own taxes and there kids schooling and there own Dotors visits. Pay there own cars rent food and clothing and still sends money to mexico.  Stop bitching because it aint illegals doing any wrong.. its all these damn Chicanos that are lazy and getting free out of jail cards...
eng_test_1641	Seems like this division of the SJW industry is doing well...
eng_test_1642	Your comment is ridiculous. Child protection laws in Canada  are unaffected by this bill. More importantly, there is the legal definition of "the age of reason" or age of Majority and Accountability, at which an individual is deemed legally able to make life-changing decisions for themselves...such as driving, drinking, voting, or smoking. In general, that is between the ages of 16 and 18.  A 6 year old child in Canada doesn't have the legal right to make decisions for themselves; what makes you believe, in any credible way, that any court or agency in the country would think a 6 year old (who, legally, isn't even considered mature enough to form the intent to commit a crime) should nevertheless be removed from its family because its wishes regarding gender weren't being respected by its parents? That's a farcical notion bordering on fear mongering. Go back and rethink your argument.
eng_test_1643	He pled guilty you fucking moron!
eng_test_1644	What a bunch of IDIOTS. The most fair and COLLECTIBLE tax is a SALES TAX.  The success of a tax is if it is widespread, can be enforced easily and is paid by those who actually purchase goods and services.  The fewer collectors of a tax the better, and there are much fewer businesses to collect a sales tax than there are residents, who may or may not honestly pay an income tax There are a LOT of income tax cheaters and to enforce collection of income tax requires a new State agency.  Auditing businesses who collect sales tax is very straightforward and very few businesses of any size cheat on sales taxes.  As a person increases their income, they buy more expensive items, therefore they pay more sales tax, Most states eliminate groceries from sales tax, so as to not unfairly hit the poor, so the sales tax is on items people CHOOSE to buy. Rich people buy planes, expensive cars, expensive homes, expensive "toys", remodel homes, buy new appliances, etc. and therefore pay more sales tax.
eng_test_1645	The left has their brand new hero, John McCain. So what if McCain lied to his constituents, just so he could put on a big show giving Trump the middle finger.  McCain's recent act is the only thing that has kept the classy dems from mocking his recent ailment.
eng_test_1646	Want to see Canada's future? Just look at the Vancouver/Toronto housing industry as what future Canadians will emulate:  Due to the permissive and accommodating attitude of Government the industry is a cesspool of money laundering, fraud, tax evasion, criminality and coercion.
eng_test_1647	you mean pilots and drivers can just drink on the job as they please too? no? so why do you think they can toke up too then? both are illegal, both you can't do as you please while on duty. in these cases, alcohol and marijuana are not the problem, it's the people who do them.  the law doesn't stop dumb people from making dumb choices.
eng_test_1648	I just knew that johann would be unable to objectively read this article without bringing up the president. JZs obsessive hatred of and disdain for Trump and posting negative comments about him no matter the subject matter of the articles is now bordering on manic obsessive and idiotic.
eng_test_1649	You have to wonder how much raw sewage those cruise ships are pumping into the salmon waters and how much air pollution they cause with those engines running to produce electricity?
eng_test_1650	If the anti-union whiners are turning up the whining, Mayor Berkowitz must be doing something right. Haha
eng_test_1651	To be clear, the road is to make it easier to leave Juneau.

eng_test_1654	This is why I hate people.
eng_test_1655	Stupid should hurt !
eng_test_1656	It's difficult for me to feel sympathy for people who go to dangerous countries/lands and then expect that their government or the United State government to do everything to get them out when they get kidnapped. Just like people who go to North Korea or on their border who get captured, get sent to prison camp and then cry for help. Or people who go hiking in dangerous weather, get stranded and then have to be rescued.  Why do you tempt fate? In life we have to take risks now and then, but it's calculated risks.
eng_test_1657	She's a stupid thug crumb no matter what race she is. Adult court, max sentence. If for nothing else, going back to the scene after successfully getting away.
eng_test_1658	Deflect, demean, dismiss. You have them all down pat Frank
eng_test_1659	Trudeau is an embarrassment and a disgrace. I hope every fool who voted for him is pleased with what they have done to this country by putting such an imbecile in charge.
eng_test_1660	No, I did not alter it. When you click on 'activity' your comments come up, both published and deleted. So I just copy and paste the deleted comment back in the appropriate place in the thread. If I had to type the whole thing out again I wouldn't bother. I reckon that if it was the moderators who had deleted it then they would do so again and if that happened I'd leave it at that. I only do it with comments that are long and have taken time to form and take care that they are not uncivil. I don't rate other people's comments as uncivil as I don't feel I have the right to be a 'thread policeman'. If someone wants to block a comment then they only remove it from their own vision, censoring a comment by rating it uncivil removes it from everybody's vision which I think is unfair. I get plenty off knock-backs in everyday life, believe me.
eng_test_1661	I'm posting from an android tablet...stop being a pedantic jerk about spelling. Yes I am Western, and yes I'm a patriotic Canadian...not a Russian troll.
eng_test_1662	None of the Canadian teams are positioned to actually challenge for the Stanley Cup this year. Should trades me made by any of them, the trade should be used to bolster their roster for next year.  The only teams that need worry about the playoff revenue are Ottawa and (maybe) Winnipeg.  Careful should be the catch word for all of them.

eng_test_1665	How can his "retirement package" be determined before it has been determined whether he acted unlawfully in his position as Chief?  If he is determined to have acted unlawfully, he should be fired, not allowed to retire, and thus his "package" should reflect that!
eng_test_1666	Nana Boo Boo is such an ass.
eng_test_1667	wrong franky, but then again i don't go around babbling about it as if it makes one smarter. totally fkn ridiculous.

eng_test_1669	Canie: we know you love a good laugh, but go easy on the boys, they played smart and hard in this one.  Even Gardiner didn't goof up, as often as he does..
eng_test_1670	Exactly. I wonder how all those Syrian refugees are making out with their new lives, in Mexico?
eng_test_1671	take a hike liberal troll, a piece of toast would be a better leader than wynne and worth voting for if it means ridding ontario of her
eng_test_1672	You've pathetic troll. Go jump on a bridge.
eng_test_1673	Trump is an ineffectual BUFFOON PATHETIC
eng_test_1674	That is precisely what he thinks and if past history is any guide, he is likely correct.  I go with that late great American philosopher George Carlin on the issue of stupid people.  "Did you ever notice that? How many really stupid people you run into during the day? Goddam there's a lot of stupid bastards walking around.  Carry a little pad and pencil with you.

eng_test_1677	I don't blame the prosecution entirely. I think a lot of the blame should be placed on the moronic judge who wouldn't allow the fireworks evidence. Really? That's like accusing someone of homicide from stabbing another person to death, yet the murder weapon or any references to knives will not be allowed to be introduced as evidence. Although I'm pretty sure the jurors knew the blacked out portions of the pictures were fireworks and not dog crap...

eng_test_1688	This has been mentioned before but bears repeating, First Nations should have established their own inquiry and therefore would have been able to structure it they way they wanted. Government could have played a secondary role in providing necessary documents, and funding where needed , although not a blank cheque. What is happening now should have been foreseen by both aboriginal leaders and government officials, and should have never been allowed to get this far. Certainly at this juncture it seems clear that it was not fully understood what the inquiry's mandate and format was. In this regard both government and First nations leaders must shoulder the blame.

You know perfectly well that Harper governed during the greatest recession since the 1930s and presented Trudeau with, not 1, but 2 balanced budgets and a growing economy.  Harper was also pushed by the power-greedy triumvirate of the NDP, Bloc and Liberals conspiring to steal power and pushing Harper to spend, spend, spend.   Only Harper was strong enough to rein in the sending a leave the Liberals such a strong economy, even in the face of falling oil prices.
eng_test_1694	A derogatory comment, term or phrase can be foul language...In fact, it is in most cases. Also those assumptions you made about Dad being a drill sergeant who didn't ever take the time to take the boy to the park is pretty far reaching. Typically a "drill sergeant" type parent are not the types of parents who write to advise columns wanting to know where they may have stepped over the line. I typically find that push over parents who have spoiled their children have issues once they try to enforce any boundary. Their children are so use to just running the ship that once a parent shows they have had enough the child disengauges and feels that since they no longer can do or say anything they want, they now have no reason to be around especially if they can do whatever they want at the other parents house.If this dad was so hard to deal with this son wouldn't be run off by dad asking him to mind his launguage at the dinner table. He would already know what dad expects and what is not ok.

eng_test_1702	You're right in that everything is in flux.  Stagnation is the alternative, and that leads to death of culture and civilization.  I think however that changes - especially putting a lot of people from disparate groups together (especially in highly populated areas like European countries) in a very short period of time is a recipe for disaster.  Even in Canada it might get iffy - how the heck do you 'hybridize' groups when 100s of thousands enter already high density cities every year? You don't.  Ethnic silos arise.   And that's where the problem begins.    We must mingle and move and change.  But having so much change forced upon people so quickly by their governments and other interest groups is NOT the way to do it.

eng_test_1704	Is it, though? Even your forecast is only0.5mbpd/yr, vs the 1.2 or 1.5 or so it grew in the 90s and early 00s, or the 1.0mbpd/y in the last ten years (  That indicates a significant flattening out of growth, indicating a plateau is imminent.   The problem arises when you forecast status quo, which might say 110-115 mpbd by 2025, vs reality (likely the 100mpbd), meaning that about 10mbpd of capacity is put out of business. Unfortunately for Canada, our pricey oil sands are likely in that bracket.

eng_test_1710	The theory of globalization is that all parties are rational actors following capitalist principles of maximizing return on investment. China appears to be following the principle of maximizing employment rather than ROI. The result has been, from our point of view,  massive Chinese malinvestment which disrupts rational competitive pricing in world trade. Western governments should have dealt with this before and perhaps Trump will, but I won't hold my breath.  That said, I suspect that automation, not globalization, is the real issue behind the loss of jobs in developed economies and perhaps the move to low wage manufacturing countries really just slowed its rate of implementation.
eng_test_1711	Why should she respond here? The unmoderated public comment sections of any newspaper have very low credibility and a tiny audience. Useless arguments and deceptive information is the norm.  I preferred her approach of letting the public record speak for itself.

eng_test_1716	"This is a competitive world."  Yup, it is.   My daughter--not "the best", nor "the brightest", but perhaps bright enough, back in Grade 12:  "I'm gonna need money for post-secondary. How to get money?  Wow: look at all the bursaries and scholarships out there. Free money! What's it take--besides applying for them? Okay, I'll go for it."  On grad day, received the Secondary Diploma from the principal, and walked down the runway, saying "thank you" to this group, and "thank you" to that group, accepting the little envelopes of cash.  Won five that day.   Only two differences between my kid and most of the others: she applied for the bucks, and she applied herself. The others won the ribbons, trophies, statuettes.
eng_test_1717	Wow - a whole 40. How many are in support across Canada? Well they get to vote, just like you and I, and they are welcome to vote for the NDP or Greens in the next federal election. They don't carry any more weight than ordinary citizens when it comes to federal decisions.

eng_test_1723	Firstly, whatever Bishop Williamson's views were re: the Holocaust, he was a validly albeit illicitly ordained bishop when he made them public. His views only became public long after his ordination and there is no precedent for the absolute revocation of Holy Orders, a bishop is Sacerdos in æternum. If I wish to deny the holocaust then am I not entitled to my belief?  Austria and Germany have sinister legislation which can gaol you for what you think. If I believe the world is flat or that the sun revolves around the earth is that sinful? Four bishops were consecrated validly but illicitly and therefore incurred excommunication because their ordinations were not sanctioned by the Pope. Benedict decided to lift the excommunications and even had he known that Williamson denied the holocaust he could not have left him out as he was not excommunicated on account of his views on the holocaust.
eng_test_1724	“What does ‘consent’ mean when the agreement is said to be made by pressing a computer key? Can it realistically be said that the consumer turned his or her mind to all the terms and gave meaningful consent?”  Well what it means for the Globe and Mail, is if you do not respond in the "right" way as to whether or not someone's else's commentary is civil or not, even if the full comment is shortened for brevity and you do not have timely access to the entire conversation, then you may lose all rights to join in any future conversation, on any topic.

eng_test_1738	Respectfully THOSF, I always save my Colorado mail-in ballots, as I don't even open them up a lot of times. If you do go vote in person here in Denver, the first thing they ask for is a state ID or driver license to verify the person and the address before they print out a ballot. I once, a few years back, tried to tell them I had no ID to see how they'd respond, they get all upset, and told me I needed one in order to vote here in Denver. I didn't push it, but I believe if I had, I'd have been given a different type of ballot, one to be counted long after the election once verified.  Secondly, mail-ins can be checked by signature match I do believe when verification is questioned, people steal mail everyday in today's world. I use separate signatures professionally, one for the mundane every day stuff, the other articulated for security verification. I don't trust mail-in's either.  Florida required me as a felon to petition for my right to vote to be restored by executive clemency.

eng_test_1754	Artie,  Thanks for pointing out the need for me to be clearer.  I'm really only saying that the range of public attitudes (and even the strength of various ideologies) is more broadly similar in Canada to those in Europe than Canadians are generally prepared to admit.  I'm not suggesting that the uglier elements should be suppressed or silenced provided that they do not engage in criminal activity or otherwise interfere with the civil rights and safety of others.  I too would prefer to see these elements out in the open where they can be opposed democratically in moderate ways.    While proportional representation and other systems that ensure that a broader array of opinions attain some formal elected representation have many merits, I suggest that we not go too far in those directions and give anti-democratic elements an entry to exercise power and influence beyond their real standing in Canada.

As far as your sweeping generalization about suburban school districts, again, where have you been as Jeffco, one of the largest suburban districts in the state, has seesawed back and forth between ideologies? Why do you assume suburbs are all conservative Republican? Across the country, urban areas tend to be more liberal, and they are teaching a heck of a lot more kids than the rural areas which tend more conservative.  In addition teachers, who ultimately have most control in classrooms, as a group tend to be liberal. http://verdantlabs.com/politics_of_professions/index.html  (continued)

When political leaks, are made to the news media, it only talks about a small part of a bigger picture.  Anything, can be taken out of context.  Politicians & the news media, are the worst abusers, of taking anything out of context.  New media hypothetical: "are you still making secret deals with Putin?"

This report and table show overall tax burden for companies in Oregon relative to other states. And overall tax burden is important. The fact that companies don't have to pay sales tax is part of the picture here. That is money that goes from companies into the state budget in other states but not in Oregon. It is big tax relief for companies operating  in Oregon. It is not so good for the state budget.
eng_test_1783	It seems to me that Trump, ever the bully and soulless opportunist, kept on this strike in order to divert attention away from Russia Gate, and his chaotic, no-nothing presidency and boost his waning popularity.   Bring us together?  No.
eng_test_1784	You show your bias by blaming the Republicans.  All parties are to be blamed, because no one will be a centrist and compromise.  It's a battle of ideologues, party agendas, union puppets, oil company puppets, a governor that is pipeline pet project obsessed and out of touch with state fiscal reality, a state bureaucracy that won't downsize, restructure and that allows people (like Brown and Twomley) to do nothing and get paid 6 figures a year and Alaskans that march to lies and fantasies, and not fiscal reality.  It's a big stinking mess of idiots trying to out-idiot each other.  Yes, Republicans are too blame for part of it.  But not all of it, by any means.

eng_test_1786	The animal welfare changes you site are smoke and mirrors for increasing animal suffering and killing lots more animals.  That's what the Whole Foods of the world do: make people feel better while increasing the underlying exploitation.  Just like laws regulating humane use of slaves back in the 1800's.  Now global capitalism and broken democracy throw "market based solutions" at everything.  If the US government in all its power and might manages to raid a few boats and free some slaves that would be an accomplishment.  But asking for an overall decrease in slavery - from the people who work on boats, to farm workers that pick tomatoes, to kids who make everything at Walmart, to children soldiers and prostitutes, etc., will not come from the large multinational companies.  It'll come from the grassroots taking back democracy globally and demanding change, as well as the return of trade unionism as a countervailing force.  Both will check and regulate the unbridled capitalism.

Houston is working on getting away with it for the current flooding where they knew it was a risk but didn't take reasonable steps to mitigate those risks.  The history of flood insurance is one of moral risk.  The question becomes since we have bailed out many areas over the years how can we say no to this one?  For Sandy it was easy for the Texas GOP representatives to say no because it was all those rich liberals up there in New England.  Now that it is hitting all of these deserving souls in the holy city of Houston the shoe is on the other foot. The last question is what happens when something like this happens in Colorado (and it has only with a smaller loss)?
eng_test_1792	Bravo, Mr FW!!
eng_test_1793	The most regressive revenue plan is put into effect by rich oil subservient Republicans. Big Surprise? NO.  The governor did not get his "package" and definitely did not get it in the order he wanted it. Therefore the parts that are passed must be vetoed. That would be leadership.
eng_test_1794	following up on her thoughts, shouldn't black athletes in the NFL and NBA....."get out of the way?" Athletes, business people, AND academia should be chosen and or rejected by their merits and qualifications.....not the color of their skin.  She's an ignorant academic racist.
eng_test_1795	So he just makes a lot of empty noise instead.
eng_test_1796	Whatever.  Leave the guy alone.  He has his beliefs.  Respect them just as you would for anyone else.  There are plenty of places to buy wedding cakes.  This is pathetic.  It's like trying to force players to stand during the anthem.  People have personal beliefs and should be allowed the freedom to live their lives according to those, no matter how stupid (like the white supremacist crowd) they seem.
eng_test_1797	War shouldn't be the first answer but with Republicans it usually is. I wonder how many in the National Guard thought they'd be going to Iraq and Afghanistan? Not many I would think since they hadn't been used that way before. Thanks, GW. No, Davis, I'm not saying our soldiers are stupid. I'm saying our leaders are.
eng_test_1798	Not as laughable as Hillary running a pedofile sex ring out of a pizza place.  Russia is known to have hacked.  A whistle blower gives us some info to investigate.  Let's investigate it.  Even if Trump is afraid of what we'll find.
eng_test_1799	Excuse me? I have it on good authority that Mexico sends their trouble makers here:  "They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists."

eng_test_1801	Do you think there is a correlation between being wealthy enough not to require any kind of risk management through insurance and personal merit? How many events in our lives, salary, investments, great losses, have been more random than not? Do you not love America enough to love the people in it, many of whom are struggling or beset by shocks in health issues?
eng_test_1802	You stupid, stupid people.  America has become psychologically unstable over the last twenty or so years ...  you really need a strong dose of something - do you have ANY idea how messed up you people have become ?  How childish, how ignorant ?  You have no idea ....   The sooner your Empire is destroyed the better
eng_test_1803	Our unbalanced, unstable President has now lost the backing of the national business leaders and his own party.  His moral authority to lead is a distant memory.  How long can this teetering house of cards stand?

eng_test_1805	What "most cases" are you basing this on, Lamont?  Not Maher Arar.  Quite true, that he didn't fight against Canadian allies.  Of course, he wasn't dragged to Afghanistan at the age of 9, either.  But he spent one year in prison, and we know he got the same amount.  The 16 British detainees got about 2$ million each for about 2 years improperly imprisoned in Guantanamo.

eng_test_1815	Trump is on the payroll of China could not be substantiated by the writer with proof. This writer, however, is definitely on the payroll of Anti-China Anglo-Saxon media outlets with all the negative portrayal of China with never a positive word. Btw China donated billions to the UN and committed the highest no. of UN peacekeeping force (8000) and affirmed the Paris Climate Agreement on top of contributing enormously to world economic growth in the last 20-30 yrs when the western, including Canada, and Japanese's economies was in the decline.

eng_test_1818	Trump doesn't understand most, or even any of the actual issues, and he's too lazy to be bothered. That's why he brays like a jack@$$ at his rallies and with twitter. It distracts his often as-ignorant base.
eng_test_1819	Liberal hypocrite and willfully ignorant, bad combination Dingbat. The GOP is the only thing that has kept America from becoming the cesspool so many other great countries have succomed to. Thank God for Trumps wisdom and courage. Few are willing to speak the truth in private,only he was willing to say it publicly.  Radical Islamic Terrorism is the greatest threat in the world. His voice helped influence the vote for Brexit and it will secure the future election of conservatives.
eng_test_1820	In my experience with my Subaru, studless winter tires with the mountain/snowflake symbol are BETTER than studded tires, even in the worst conditions that we get.  That's even with the cheap ones, like $50 Firestone WinterForce tires.  You don't have to go to Bridgestone Blizzaks, Michelin X-Ice, or similar more expensive studless tires.  The mountain/snowflake symbol is the way to identify proper winter tires.  Tires with this symbol are required in the winter in BC and some other places in Canada.  We should just ban studded tires, phasing them out over several years, like a lot of other places do.  That will do a lot more for our budget and our roads than the amount the proposed tax would generate.

eng_test_1822	So is Canada about killing someone that leaves Islam? Is Canada about muslims marching on AL QUDS day chanting to kill jews? Is Canada about Imams telling the mosque to go kill Jews?

Is Canada about honor killings? Is Canada about Sharia law. ?  Is Canada about Imams suggesting we all wear burqas so we don't get raped? Your comment suggests we should all accept this behaviour from muslims Be sheep. be ok with this ---Sharia-ism - like communism and Nazism - destroys the rights of all people.  .https://youtu.be/Lc6GVg3GfuI ps this is the video of the man defending his right to have sex with 9 yr old adults.

eng_test_1826	Well, from where I sit, the senior contributor category ceased to have any value whatsoever when Jethro Jones got it last year as a thanks for his help with the Raiders.  Aren't people supposed to be retired when they get inducted?  Well, yes, players and coaches have to be.    Honestly, it doesn't matter to me when or if Bowlen gets it.  It's forever tainted.  I do wish he had been able to enjoy the moment, which would, could and should have been possible.
eng_test_1827	Going forward, please keep your idiot son at home!  This was completely preventable.  Hope he learned his lesson!
eng_test_1828	It is indeed sad that rather than lead by example Trump instead incites the divisive tenor seen in many of the comments posted here. His comments and behaviors are simply beneath the dignity of the office, and he seemingly enjoys having people conflict with one another - remember the countless instances of him encouraging anger during his campaign? He is used to spectacles and entertainment; he has no understanding of leading or being principled. This is simply no longer funny.
eng_test_1829	Thanks for totally outing yourself as a racist.
eng_test_1830	In scheer's case, could it be both? Because it's certainly the first.
eng_test_1831	Fine and dandy, we all agree we are a nation of immigrants. Bottom line is in today's world, refugee seekers need to be thoroughly vetted refugees! Anything less is pure stupidity.  The executive order is TEMPORARY so that vetting process can be set, which has been NONEXISTENT with the Obama regime over the past 8 years. Pres Trump is now correcting the stupidity of the last administration! You protesters need to get a life and learn how to ski, or something else to get your head out of the darkness!
eng_test_1832	Why? When I could keep enticing my flaming liberal California friends into moving to Denver?   Are you one of those jerks who thinks carpool lane laws don't apply to you? Perhaps you need a nice ticket!

eng_test_1835	More hate from the retard. Flagged
eng_test_1836	"But the bulk of Liberal deficit spending has not been about infrastructure. It’s borrowing for groceries more than for the mortgage.". Precisely.  Trudeau's ill concieved promise of a few budgets of $10 billion deficit for 'infrastructure' has given way to bloated largesse. To do this at at time of positive GDP growth is farsical, unwise and even irresponsible.   Trudeau may have captured the star struck hearts of many but plenty of us still recall the painful '90s when Chretien and Martin finally pushed us back from the brink of fiscal crush with large tax increases and large spending cuts.    Careful Justin, you're on a dangerous path.
eng_test_1837	If health care is a human right, what do you do for a living? Are your services a human right as well? This idea is silly to say the least. Forcing someone at gunpoint (that's what laws are) to provide their health care services is evil. Doctors and nurses are hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, but they should treat you for free, even if you refuse to work hard like they do. Such absurdity.
eng_test_1838	Of course what you say is true.  We indigenous people are a fair bunch and try to support our neighbours.   This is difficult at times however since we did not become citizens, as a group, until 1956.  We were never asked, as all others who came here, to raise our hand and swear allegiance.  (Soldiers of course, of the various french and british regiments, probably did not raise their hands either, but they had built in allegiances and were under orders).   We were just made Canadian.  Twenty years later, we even got to vote.  This leaves a bit of a mark on one's psyche.....
eng_test_1839	But it's only about an hour and a half daily drive to/from downtown Vancouver. WooHoo!!!
eng_test_1840	When our pathetic racist president Obama said police acted stupidly in the D.C. case he declared open season on police across America. He is to blame for the racial divide in America today.  And in other news , blacks continued to slaughter other blacks last weekend in Chicago. Where is the protest over that ?  Black lives clearly don't matter if blacks are the ones doing the killing.
eng_test_1841	Looks like some people who have been on the waiting list for years will finally get their season tickets. As to those who are leaving, well, don't let the door hitcha where nature splitcha.

eng_test_1845	I sort of remember the same apocalyptic vison back when Reagan was elected.    The Nation survived, the USSR didn't.    He ended my tax deduction for interest on my personal  Credit Cards,   He granted amnesty to immigrants conditioned on sealing the borders.

eng_test_1847	This is like blaming the victim.  Good business practice would dictate that certain businesses should take additional security measures to protect their wares.  This should be common sense, but people look at it the same way they do insurance.  "It'll never happen to me."  Until it does.
eng_test_1848	I suspect Brock will be gone by mid-season when Lynch is healthy.... but it's not hard to understand that playing against vanilla defenses - especially one that wasn't game planning, just playing reserves trying to figure out who to keep on the roster - would be significantly different than a game during the season. Elway, of all people, understand that all too well... I can see why he would be a little skittish about having a rookie QB - especially one with relatively little snaps during training camp - as a backup QB. You wouldn't be much better off than putting in the WR that was the backup during the 4th pre-season game.
eng_test_1849	How is it off topic?  The article is talking about overdoses and presidential policy.  It is basing the analysis on 2016 data.  Who was in charge of presidential policy in 2016?
eng_test_1850	In keeping with my last question, what does, "There are many issues altering climate change, just like they have been for eons" mean? Issues? That doesn't sound very sciency.

The Pro-life movement associated with the Susan B Anthony group have already doused themselves in the Trump Swamp. They have forever weakened and dirtied their message by glorifying the Pussy Grabber in Chief. Many people who may have been supportive of their work will turn away because of their mindless support of the GOP and a man like T rump.

eng_test_1864	Usually they just ignore their own rules. They can, for the sake of appearance, suspend them; however, that isn't a primary danger to our legislative process.  That danger is the creation of a particular  "rule" from whole cloth.  This is the "rule" that allows an individual legislator to have defacto veto power by simply refusing to hold hearings on bills.  That legislator cannot be voted out of office except by his or her constituents so every other Alaskan is effectively disenfranchised by this action.  This can be done with no explanation required or having to obtain concurrence with his or her action from committee members. This is the power BIll Allen was purchasing from the legislators who went to jail.  You want to have a discussion Mr. Eastman, please talk about that practice.
eng_test_1865	Here let me sum up the stupidity of all parties involved, your all being played against each other for the power brokers to stay in power and for you mindless robots that want to fight about my comment, well keep fighting for stupid and you will receive stupid. open your eye's to the truth and evil will fail, once you ignore the truth for the lie than soon the good of life will suffer and this is the point we all are at in this stupid race did you ever look at the word race? running anti community environment, to destroy the unity in the nation to cause a divide and the fall of the country over time and look at us now, are we united or divided as a country what ever happened to proud to be American and now turned to shame for we as a nation have lost what our purpose has been to unite and defend the freedoms countless others have gave, heroes who risked their lives for others so that we all may enjoy our freedoms and now are we to throw it all away for power and greed, shame on us all.

eng_test_1891	First - It's not 'his slum'. That belongs to the previous owner who let it get in that condition.  Second - He's actively trying to renovate the place and to do that takes money. The way you get money from rental property is to raise rents.  Third - This isn't an apartment building. It's a motel. The previous owner let people use it as long term housing but that's not something the new owner has to continue. Once the place is renovated he may allow it. He may not. But it's his decision.

eng_test_1893	Calgary is an interesting case study: over the course of the 2+ year oil price collapse, the "experts" all predicted a bloodbath in the Calgary real estate market.  Buyers were about to get slaughtered we were all told. The Alberta haters all held their breath, gleefully predicting the worst.  And now that the Alberta economy is clawing its way back, adjusting to the new oil reality with brutal cost cutting measures, folks are still waiting for that real estate bloodbath.  Buyers from 2 years ago are either at break even or just slightly above or below it. With 2 years of enforced savings via mortgage payments under their belt.  Regardless of where you live in Canada, over the long term, buying beats renting, unless you are a short term flipper. In which case, who cares?
eng_test_1894	You're an idiot. Your statement proves to me that you're one of left-wingers who voted for Obama and supported him in his efforts to totally destroy our Constitution. Fortunately we were saved by that same Constitution, and we hired Mr. Trump to speed the healing. We are in the process of draining you...
eng_test_1895	Oh no. Not that "losing an hour of sleep" nonsense again. That's why the time change is done on Saturday night. You won't lose sleep unless you're foolish enough to use an alarm clock on a Sunday morning. (Apologies to those who must work Sundays.)   I know there are studies saying that the change messes people up. How much of that is because thousands of people reading articles like this expect a bad day on Monday? It's only a one-hour change. In ordinary life, it is not unusual for bedtime to vary by an hour because of things we must do in work or social life, or even because there's something good on TV.  The worst part of Daylight Savings Time is changing all of your clocks. I'd be happy to keep DST year-round.

He has the ability to see the entire horizon, far into the future. . His strategy of adult, non-violent, reasoned, civic behaviour is both correct and powerful. . He is leading by example. . The example he sets is that of government based on reasoned discussion by people of goodwill in the marketplace of ideas - the core principle upon which America was founded. . The followers he attracts will be quality people of intellect and character. . In Huck Finn, the story of the King and the Duke ends when the doctor, who has silently and patiently waited for the townsfolk to come to their senses, is seen to have shown forbearance and wisdom, and ultimately prevails - but not until a lot of the townsfolk are sadder but wiser themselves, too. .

eng_test_1910	Who is the stupid head who built a rock wall to enclose the boat dock across the street from the Oahu Club. That was supposed to be left open so floods can drain naturally. Now this will cause delayed drainage and more flooding to wider areas. Destroy it now!
eng_test_1911	Well, well, well, Senator Corker has the gonads to tell the Voice of America what he really thinks. And, not unexpectedly, The Voice didn't like what he heard. He actually had the temerity to suggest that Senator Corker and he should be given intelligence tests and there would be no doubt who would be the winner. Well, he was right about one thing. There would indeed be no doubt who would be the winner.  And it wouldn't be he. The stupidity of this man, The Voice, is mind boggling in the extreme. And all of this comes soon after Rex Tillerson was reported to have called him a moron.  And he didn't deny he had said it. Things are just getting worse and worse for The Voice. Let's face it, he is doomed. It's just a matter of time before the house of cards collapses. It is long overdue already.
eng_test_1912	Trump is a liar, a racist and a disaster. He will never be "President Trump;" respect is earned not ascribed. Where was your respect for the office of President when you were referring to Obama by various racial slurs and spouting crap about his birth certificate and religion? I guess respect only needs to be given if the president is white, huh Lars?  You and all of Trump's other white nationalist supporters have a lot to answer for, and make no mistake, sooner or later you will.
eng_test_1913	This is a good law. There will always be opposition to any change. But it is important that the developers address all the concerns of the opposition.
eng_test_1914	"Actually" an individual will now be able to grow 4 plants perfectly legally, yeilding, say, 200 grams each. Even at 5 dollars a gram that's 4000 dollars worth of weed per individual a couple or 3 of times a year if you like. Yet somehow we are supposed to believe that the government will be able to magically prevent this from becoming what it calls in c-45 "illicit cannibis", when it can't enforce the existing laws now. You can walk into a store in any major city in this country and buy it now, despite the "crackdown" on the pot dispensaries (which is resulting in almost no convictions), and that doesn't include the online market. So color me skeptical that this market can be meaningfully "regulated" at all.

eng_test_1919	Excellent. The editorial writer invokes the Bible and Christianity as if they were relevant. Ludicrous. Donald Trump is an old, fat, hate-filled bigot. Just because Sarah Huckabee became a temporary, stand-in press secretary hardly means a thing. If there is a betrayal of American values it's not Trump's fault. He can barely read and is well despised. He grandstands. He promotes his own interests and had the audacity to suck up to Russia and its tiny dictator, Vladimir Putin. That's the real issue. If America refuses to resolve the issue it has with Trump's evil influence then it has no one to blame but itself.

eng_test_1931	Hancock is the mayor of Denver, the core city of the Denver metro area, not Aurora, not Englewood or Littleton or Limon or Topeka, Kansas. He has absolutely zero authority to take the tax revenues from Denver and spend them to improve these other suggested cities. That would explain why he's working on affordable housing in Denver. That's Denver with a D. It's where the state capital and capitol are located. Why don't you call the mayors of these cities and ask them to provide affordable housing, so you can live in Denver and not have higher taxes?

eng_test_1941	Personally, the major variable for me is that the only candidate that the Democrats would run with was Hillary with all of her and Bill's 30 years of baggage.  From the DNC on down to the precinct level and the extra Democratic delegates, they insisted that she was the one who had  to be anointed.    Your position is clearly supported by the fact that the 16 others on the Republican ticket could not appeal to the elite or to their rank and file, however.    We have gone from Obama's "Hope and Change" to "Almost Any Kind of Change!"

eng_test_1967	Gary, as an old liberal myself I'm surprised at your attempt to equalize the ranting of Trump with those who have been critical of Prof. Schurtz's blackface performance.  Until a review of this case has been published I'll avoid an opinion, though it's  obvious the idea of firing a senior tenured professor was ridiculous.  At the same time, lets' remember that with campus politics, a party at a senior prof's home is hardly "private."  While not everyone who comments here would agree, most historians would agree with Pres. Schill's immediate response that "The use of blackface, even in jest at a Halloween party is patently offensive  and reinforces  historically racist stereotypes."  Three questions I hope will be answered by the investigation are,  1. If any minorities were invited, how did they feel?  2. If any junior faculty or law students were present, would they have felt safe criticizing her performance?  3. What does her long vita reveal about her interest in racial diversity?

eng_test_2003	newshound777,  You are correct to stress that Trump is an odious person in these matters & implicitly that it is no excuse that he's channelling the rage of significant elements of US society.

eng_test_2011	For me it is because of Him.
eng_test_2012	Just saying.  Yes we had deficits during the Obama years but let me remind you we had the worst economic crisis since the great depression which started in the GW years.  There were reasons for the deficits.  Now the idiot is going to expand the deficits and for what?  Poor little rich folk won't have to pay taxes as much.  You don't have to be a genius to see where this will head.  Fortunately, the Donald probably will fail once again.  One can always hope.

But had He limited our free will there would have been no point in gifting us with it.  Mathematically speaking, it is a far greater act of faith to believe we have become what we are due to random events lacking any guidance whatsoever, much less believe the Big Bang where nothing became something without any serious theory much less proof of a mechanism for it to do so and no intelligent instigator to compel it.
eng_test_2019	Are you a moron? He's not kneeling because of econonomic injustice in inner cities. Nothing about his peaceful protest has anything to do with his upper class upbringing or his wealth. It is about the systemic injustice that black people in America face every day. Every black person I know has been afraid of getting pulled over for no reason, except they are black. The shooting of black people by the police are incomparable to shootings of white people pm e by police. Forget black on black or white people, this is about oppression. The fact that you have no understanding of this means you're clearly white, privileged, and ignorant. Or just stupid. You have no business writing anything about this situation.

eng_test_2027	Sure it did. Not a thing wrong with it. Someone just embarrassed themselves and wanted the comment pointing it out removed. Pointing out ageism is not "gaslighting" or "criminal harassment"  or the lesser "bullying" (duali's claims). But the fact that someone would try and make that claim is evidence of how far gone some elements of our culture are.
eng_test_2028	Trump did NOT make a spelling mistake. Everybody thinks he is talking about America getting over an illness, and becoming healthy again. NO HE"S NOT.  Trump doesn't give a tinker's damn about that. Trump is talking about OBEDIENCE!  Dogs and little people will come to heel.  In -45's narcissistic racist brain, the protests are a necessary prerequisite of becoming obedient.... and America WILL become obedient to him. That tweet isn't funny, it is the horrifying rant of an enraged megalomaniac.
eng_test_2029	Ms. Moore is a newspaper columnist, and a damn good one.  The content of Moore's column has nothing to do with whether she's a Democrat or a Republican.  Naysayers' attempt to try and discredit her op-ed need their head examined.  Those that choose to bash Moore instead of addressing Cathy Munoz's public support of two child rapists come across as supporting the rapists.  Attacking the messenger only makes you people look foolish (i.e. Dick Rhyner).

eng_test_2031	RE: your last line, Layla4.  Opinions are just that. Publishing them without any "verification" of the facts, gives the likes of you and I the opportunity to step forward and say, "Hey, wait a minute!" and expose the idiocy. So, a great service, no?  Speaking of idiocy...I found this amusing: The former editor says, "Social media has let loose all kinds of dark instincts that were lurking. When you thought it was just your own dark thoughts, and there was nobody who shared them, maybe you wouldn't have been so loud about them. But when you find there are a whole bunch of people who agree, it does give you volume."  Social media doesn't care about the type of thoughts or instincts. Neither does MSM. It disseminates EVERYTHING, "dark" or "light."  And without social media, who would read/see/hear feminists' thoughts?  Well, there'd be "nobody who shared them," and nobody'd know that "there are a whole bunch of people who agree."  The height of irony.

eng_test_2034	Story headline says: "Canadian finance ministers to discuss marijuana taxation in Ottawa"  Personally I think that legalizing the sale of marijuana is a bad move but Justin and Gerry seem to want to do this.  So, first thing is that the tax on marijuana should be at least as high as that on tobacco, if not higher.  Second thing is that penalties associated with "actions while under the influence" should more stringent than any associated with alcohol as I've been told that one gets higher quicker and more so with marijuana than with alcohol.

eng_test_2037	What the hell is it to you?
eng_test_2038	I hate when Canada chooses to play the self-righteous moron. The comment was not strategic, not practical and does not move the Syria disaster closer to a solution.

eng_test_2039	Gee, they get to announce that they will do what is right. Pathetic.
eng_test_2040	How about instead of letting the Republican legislators dink with the Perm Fund we put a permanent cap on their pensions by voting them out of office.
eng_test_2041	Just a distraction, I’d much more interested in the obstruction, collusion & stupidity of the trump administration.  Sorry, I forgot, it’s in the news every day, lol
eng_test_2042	he obviously writes this pureille vacuous garbage in the Enquirer
eng_test_2043	Idpa--are you that dense or do you listen to el rushbo trying to make Trump look smart? Either way, you lose.
eng_test_2044	No one thought that Andersen was going to be better than Reamer.  Both are essentially back-up goalies.  The Leafs just wanted to get rid of the gormless April, so they swapped one loser for another.
eng_test_2045	This is the standard dumb voter response. Blame anything but yourself. That's exactly how we got Turnip. When one of a choice is a catastrophe, only a fool is unable to make the right choice. A lot of people voted out of spite and vanity and they deserve our wholehearted contempt.
eng_test_2046	McCain is just another GOP sucker.
eng_test_2047	and again miller being the nut job left winger you are spews the stupidity see loser of governmetn love trump is an investor in projects , some you win, some you loose,  by far most he has won, some gone under, he personly hs never gone bankrupt. thats how it works when you risk your money to better things but we understand ignorant losers like you cant understand such things.. and as for your left wing usual nonsense about putin, well keep crying loser,, you want a tissue!!!
eng_test_2048	I just read "corrupt bastards club",  I think these idiots are far worse, the politicians who started this should be voted out and castrated, this state is in financial dire and they want to spend money like it's flowing turds out of the toilet in buckets, here is a little lesson, if your budget at home says all you can afford is beans and weineys, that's what your eating,  unless your spending somebody else's money, and that folks is their mentality,,, what was the building appraised at,  I thought 24k or 26k,  if that's the case, that's the price, I've never seen a car dealership raise the price when purchasing, except with these idiots,,,
eng_test_2049	I'd lean towards saying that AST is on the hook for policing the area. While Girdwood is inside the municipality, the MOA can't force APD officers on Girdwood unless Girdwood accepts the alteration to the metropolitan police service area. The city is expressly barred from altering it without a vote of the affected people.  AST however is required under Alaska Statute to police the whole state regardless of anything else. Therefore if a crime were committed, AST would have the statutory requirement to be the lead investigative agency.
eng_test_2050	sailfish2,  You probably have the right of it.  People meaning to do harm to others may sometimes be morons or imbeciles, but most of them are far from idiots.  And with enough money and feeling nothing to lose, I would think most people in that situation and frame of mind would not find it impossible to acquire an illicit gun, maybe even a good one.  Have a good night!
eng_test_2051	Keep watching faux news you idiot!!!
eng_test_2052	Oh come on TDW, wake up man, when in the 50's, 60's 70's and even the 80's did you find luxury or upscale trucks. Now they are a dime a dozen. Half the clowns that own them want every conceivable luxury appointment and are afraid to get the box dirty.  Some on here often call those who spend 50 or 60 grand on a Mercedes as fools but to me the biggest group of fools are those who spend that on a truck.
eng_test_2053	First thank you. I did read that article and I had not seen it  before.   But second, I happen to know folks who sell health insurance. What ties their hands is the High Cost of getting licensed state by individual state. It was what they tried to tell Congress during ACA creation, to no avail. In a open market, businesses compete if they have 'like' businesses around them. It results in normally lower costs for the consumer. Open the competition up across state lines. The more companies competing the better for us.   Second, address Medical Malpractice lawsuits. That insurance the doctors carry drives up our costs per visit.  Quite often, bogus claims are settled out of court, as it is cheaper than defending the practitioner. Change that by one thing-the losing party pay all court costs, all legal fees. That will give pause to ambulance chasers.
eng_test_2054	Wonder if they will change the language on welfare checks n food stamps. Yea didnt think so. This is all about stupidity.
eng_test_2055	Thus is the mindset of former politicians, and liberals who believe that bigger and bigger Government interference and control is the answer to everything.  This mindset is one of the reasons that 'Governments' that have the power to tax always have a bloated and wasteful budget.    If the Theater is so nice and neat, all of those who like it need to get their hands out of their neighbors pockets and dig in their own.  Form a LLC, buy the building and preserve it.  Leave the rest of the State out of it.
eng_test_2056	Dianne Watts will just carry on with the Clark agenda as she seems to have the same backers. It would be interesting to know if she has made any financial arrangements with her backers before she quit her job as MP job and entered the race. I doubt she can we the leadership race. I don't think liberals are ready for another Clark.
eng_test_2057	Nobody cares about stupid if stupid doesn't care about herself or her baby. Keep your body clean during pregnancy damn.
eng_test_2058	There's your problem right there. Trump nuts are confused because they don't understand reality.
eng_test_2059	My skin and genitalia are the same colour, aren't yours?
eng_test_2060	It's been fairly obvious for at least a decade that corruption was rife, and it's surprising only that it took so long for it to become public knowledge.
eng_test_2061	That explains the stupidity.
eng_test_2062	True.   Just like the morons who think standing during a song supports the troops.
eng_test_2063	bc the voice of stupidity, there is no settled science on man carbon heating the climate, NONE! no one deny's the changes but no one can show mans carbon is the cause NO ONE, in fact time and time again we see manipulated data to spread that bs
eng_test_2064	This article is bait that attracts racists like turd attracts flies. I have seen your anti-Muslim posts as well.
eng_test_2065	Of course power generation costs are the result of TOU electrical pricing.  Smart meters and TOU pricing were brought in as a means of having consumers directly pay for the high contract costs the government made with wind and solar producers. Remove wind and solar from the picture and, the cost of generation drops to roughly $.0325 cents per kWh. In Ontario prior to the Liberals messing things up, we paid for electricity based on the "cost average model". Which meant everyone paid the same low price for their electricity. The same costing model used by every business in the world.  The Liberals needed wind and solar to help cement their green dream legacy. First they created the myth electricity costs more at certain times and people using that electricity should pay higher prices. Once the people believed, in came smart meters and TOU pricing. As more wind and solar projects were added, the government incrementally increased the TOU rates to cover the new contract costs.
eng_test_2066	No one said it is unconstitutional for a teen to tell her parents that she is going to have an abortion.  And, most early abortions are by medicine, not surgery at all.  So many people on this board are not even discussing the issue decided upon by the court.
eng_test_2067	This letter by a woman is too sensible.  She must be crazy.
eng_test_2068	The University has no place supporting sports that already have huge private funding, like hockey, football, or basketball; or that are fundamentally noncompetitive, like college gymnastics.  They still have should have a role in sponsoring selected less popular (lucrative) sports where college athletes can be competitive internationally and there is little private market, such as: biathlon, track, cross country, etc.  Cut that fat!
eng_test_2069	My JJ you have good taste. KD Lang's "Ingenue" is in my top five for instrumentation, arrangements, and outstanding recording quality. Miss Chantalaine's lyric and melody is hauntingly rich. Other artists on the list are Ricky Lee Jones, Paul Simon, Roseann Cash, and Steely Dan. Music Rules!
eng_test_2070	The real lying, cheating, treating taxpayers like crap liberals never went away. They just got a sunny makeover. And now haze is starting to clear and show these scums living off us and benefiting by being in power.
eng_test_2071	KOCHs can leave permanently.
eng_test_2072	Obviously, Laura Mulligan's statement proves she's an idiot. There should be a policy of letter rejection if the first sentence demonstrates imbecility on the part of the writer.
eng_test_2073	Truly a catastrophe, now they will do the crap jobs you don't want to do.
eng_test_2074	IF the 14 year old is guilty, he should be treated like an adult and put away.  If that idiot and whoever else was involved can go around attacking people, whether by stabbing, using a bat or by any other means, then they better be convicted of the crime too.
eng_test_2075	I predict Trump will become the most loathed political figure in the United States within 6 months and all the fake patriots who voted for him will lie to everyone they know and say they didn't vote for him. Of course, any American with half a brain--those who didn't vote for the scumbag--will know exactly who voted for this filthy traitor. Putin played rural, racist and ignorant Americans and they fell for his bait. They gave him the keys to our democracy and now he and his billionaires will loot.
eng_test_2076	what a pathetic comment...and then deception mode by pulling the Harper card...disgraceful.
eng_test_2077	Don't think like a fink!
eng_test_2078	Respectfully VRJ, I was always told such a threat or assertion concerning the president was a felony punishable with a federal prison sentence. But I guess some folk get a free pass, They can break our nation's laws, pick and choose which laws they obey, riot and loot when the opportunity arises such as a candidate speaking or when something they oppose like the G8 summit comes to town. It's their freedom and right to do so anymore, just like this lady talking about she wishes the president to be assassinated.        How easy it seems for succeeding generations who weren't around for the Kennedy assassinations, or woke up one morning as a kid to hear Dr. King was assassinated, to just callously throw out such phrases. As a kid, they were monumental events that were so tragic for our nation, that they remained forever etched and seared in one's memory.
eng_test_2079	A better bet would be to maximize your investments and stop worrying about taxes. I say this because it has worked for me. Invest in U.S. multinationals with low P/E ratios and good dividends and do not talk to financial advisors, lawyers, accountants or brokers and you'll do just fine.
eng_test_2080	The depth of criminal corruption embodied in this buffoon becomes more glaring every day.  Now the embarassment of this spoiled, rich brat accesses the world stage to display for all the absolute idiocy perpetrated by the Republican Traitor Party upon our nation.  Time to deep-six the entire party from any involvement in the governing system.  They are all traitors and determined to destroy our Constitional Republic and all human rights contained therein.  Time for a Revolution.
eng_test_2081	Its like a Hydra....eliminate all drug dealers out there and they magically reappear. Thats what idiot Trump does not understand. Even with a wall, they will probably tunnel between the two countries and improve their transportation network.  The best is not to develop the addiction in the first place.  Anyways, there is a population explosion so perhaps this is just a way of culling the herd.
eng_test_2082	we need to call out gerry butts.....he most certainly is doing a shitty job.  he ruined ontario and stupid pm hired him to run the country defacto.  Butts is doing a horrible job and let's not forget that.
eng_test_2083	I totally agree !  I have been using synthetic oil for years, and still notice how much rougher the engine sounds when cold. Yes, 10 min. of warming is excessive, but 1-to-2 min. is prudent.
eng_test_2084	Another person who feels embolden by Trump and Bannon. Lock him up!
eng_test_2085	are you serious?  You want the PM of a G7 nation to live in a private home?  Even the leaders of poor african nations have palaces they live in.    You don't have to spend hundreds of millions - but when yo consider the federal government spends about $300B a year surely we can afford a few million for a proper residence.
eng_test_2086	What is wrong with you people in Ontario?   This is next level corruption and you all let it happen.   As an Albertan living in Ontario, I'm actually ashamed to live among a bunch of pathetic sheep like you.   You may call us hicks, but at least we aren't scared of our shadows and won't elect someone new because its scarier than putting up with what is undoubtedly the absolute worst, corrupt, evil bunch of government leaders I've ever seen.
eng_test_2087	Unfortunately, they must not have taught this lesson at Punahou.  I am sure that NYU is great center of learning, but that seems to be lost on such a privileged person who attended Punahou.  Following in the footsteps of their great alumnus, Barry Obama, it seems that basic understanding of the law need not be learned for those of the upper class of society.  If this was a poor, drunk Native Hawaiian who harassed a monk seal, this man would be in jail on the felony counts.  Lucky, this moron's parents could afford high priced lawyers to allow him to get slapped on the wrist.
eng_test_2088	Lots of room for him in Gitmo.
eng_test_2089	Hope parents are happy now.  Kids biggest losers in this one.
eng_test_2090	Perhaps, this article would make good reading for the Conservatives and right-wing alarmists in Canada.  Instead of whipping up resentment and hate for those to come to Canada as refugees or plain ordinary migrants, they add to the rich fabric of Canada and prove that these people become important for the economic fabric of this country also.  We all came from somewhere even the indigenous people of this land.
eng_test_2091	Michael, you've outdone yourself!  Your singular obsession with Hilary Clinton is so Catholic Churchy.  Darn that female. Women cannot be trusted.  I am anxiously awaiting your column on the charge of underage rape and court date for Donald Trump.
eng_test_2092	Dragging his feet at the FBI is second in command Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. You might recall his name from a few weeks back; his wife got political contributions of almost $700,000 from a close Clinton associate.
eng_test_2093	Officials at state track meet need to get a clue.  Bend over backwards to let our kids perform.  To disqualify children from what for many is the culmination of years of sacrifice is shameful.  It takes a pretty horrible bunch of petty adults to impose their inadequacies on children in a way that will last a lifetime!
eng_test_2094	Welcome back Jose!  Just hit the ball and everything else will fall into place.
eng_test_2095	It is true that I believe that we must respect the lives of our fellow citizens.  I have great trouble with your comment "I would gladly have cleaned up the mess if he had followed through on his threat," which you made on this page.  The comment appears to utterly devalue the life of another citizen and in fact you have only the information from the press to support that conclusion.  Sorry, but I believe that crime itself derives directly from the tendency to devalue our fellow citizens.  The man involved may have done many good things in his life.  Yet, you are willing to condone his suicide and clean up the mess based on this one tenuous media report?  No, I am a supporter of rational criminal justice that begins with the assumption of the value of our fellow humans and aims to rationally correct deviations sans revenge or utter devaluation of life.
eng_test_2096	Why is this a surprise?  About two-thirds of all people are stupid and/or ignorant.
eng_test_2097	What exactly is your point?  Were you thinking that your idiotic comment was somehow relevant?  Or do guns scare you somehow? Unfortunate that a fellow bank customer wasn't also exercising their 2nd Amendment rights as well as their practiced shooting stance and accuracy.
eng_test_2098	Would like the opinion of the veterans and current soldiers that have, like Gabbard, actually deployed to the middle East and faced the metal. That would hold much more clout than words and opinions gleaned from desktop jockies.
eng_test_2099	our Pm is such a baboon.....no one respects him, he is useless and incompetent.  why is he prancing around the country as if he is "hot stuff" - he is pathetic. I hope those who voted for him see what he is really all about now.  Instead of helping Canadians he is helping his own cuases BUT WITH OUR TAX DOLLARS.  The power has gone to his little big fat head!  Number 1 goof ball ever.  How embarassing for Canada.
eng_test_2100	We DONT need DACA recipients to support our SS and welfare!!!! Since 1986 amnesty, the illegal alien population has increased from 3.6 million to 12-20 million!!!! DACAs make piddling little money and they and their parents and anchor rat siblings have BLED OUR COUNTRY DRY TO ITS BONES.  They cost us a MINIMUM OF 200 billion each year......K-12 education at 15 k each school year, ESL classes, overcrowding in schools, free medical (been to an ER lately???), 20k for popping out each illegal anchor rat, in-state tuition, incarceration in prison, judicial expenses for their false claims, use of infrastructure for free and sending BILLIONS in remittances to their country!   So, multiply 30 years (since 1986) times 200 billion = 6 TRILLION $$$$$!!!!!!!! SIX FREAKING trillion......for liars, cheaters, law breakers and THIEVES,!!!!  PRESIDENT TRUMP, RESCIND DACA AND DEPORT THEM ALL IMMEDIATELY,!!

eng_test_2106	Yet another one opts for the play dumb ploy.
eng_test_2107	Two things I particular sadden me about the current decisions being made by UA:  1. Targeting skiing and other small sports was a cowardly move in the first place.  The programs which were on the chopping block represented a small fraction of the UA sports budget.  The University bet that such small programs would be easy to cut because who cares about skiing anyway?  They were wrong and the skiing community put forth a show.  Which brings me to point #2.  2. It is unfortunate that the Board of Regents let the community sway their decision with promises of self support.  Exactly how long do we expect private citizens to keep interest in funding a sport up to 80%? My guess is that it might happen next season and maybe the one after that.  However, I really do not think that is a sustainable model.  None of this even touches on the elephant in the room: the hockey program.  That is the real issue which needs to be addressed.  Everything else is just fluff.
eng_test_2108	Unbelievable how anyone can support this terrorist. Unless maybe they are also terrorists? He is a traitor and a terrorist, he should not get a penny of my money and should be in jail! Unbelievable!
eng_test_2109	I must have read the wrong article because the one I read said "37 caribou carcasses" were discovered with the others being harvested. I was appalled by this event as well but can you provide the statewide annual number of wanton waste cases? I tried to locate a ballpark figure but was unable.  The first commercial whaling vessel showed up in 1854 and although there was lots of trading I doubt the Inuit had any devastating impact of whale populations considering they had no vessels capable of mass harvest of whale oil.  With responsibility comes accountability and although you deem my understanding of the world as poor, I see nothing wrong with allowing the first peoples a say in the responsibility of stewardship over a resource, that for them, means sustainability.

eng_test_2114	Just to point out something that has been mentioned many times when NK is involved; NK and South Korea have technically been at war since 1950.  Too bad Truman didn't let McArthur finish the job...
eng_test_2115	Goldbert, our most accomplished and learned writer on mainstream art was not inspired by this stuff to do anything besides describe it, clinically. Why? It's so ho-hum and passe, IMO. When are artists and those playing the part going to get over thinking that the "viewer" is a dummy in need or proctoring in how to experience life. The audience wants mainstream art, not being treated like freshman design students. Come on, now.
eng_test_2116	Because the "U" section of the alphabet in travel guides and tourist magazines is so stuffed to the rafters already?  The town voted to change it's name.  From the comments, it sounds like they did not survey the feelings of all the little snowflakes who don't live there but who feel it is their business to care about the name change anyway.  I'm assuming the snowflakes in question are not conservatives, as state and local autonomy is a central tenet of small government, so they must be fans of a sprawling government big enough to get in their and root out any thought- or spelling-crimes before they happen.
eng_test_2117	Oh Ronin666 you told me I was the master of insults. I'm hurt. Glad to see some else is will to insult you when you say stupid MAGAphatitic (ooooh, I just made you an adjective) things, which seems to be all the time. Now no more crying for being called stupid. If you don't want to be called names that highlight your stupidity, stop saying stupid Fox-lapdog nonsense. I really feel all the baby-in-chief failures are driving you slowly crazy. I'm so enjoying it.

eng_test_2120	I think that's just what the media tells you.  Australia's crime rate has gone up.    I think one viable solution would be to teach anger management in schools, but apparently, that's more disturbing to some people than taking away everyone's right to protect themselves.

eng_test_2125	This from a racist who lives under a rock and shares its IQ.  Disgusting.
eng_test_2126	Indeed. If Kyle Sloter continues to prove up to snuff, the Broncos will surely find a place for him. The quaint fear of "rocking the boat too much," seems secondary to finding and exploiting a talent. After all, Paxton Lynch has soiled himself and John Elway has better things to do other than coddling a grown man, who by the way, looks like a Grade B. Villain.

eng_test_2129	Going after people based on their religion is classic behaviour of a fascist. Ruling by decree instead of going to your elected officials is again a reflex of someone who doesn’t respect the fundamental nature of a democratic society.”  ROFLOL, This is a simplistic ton of BS.  Yes in every reasonable case your correct.  However I seriously beg to differ here.  Were talking about a religion that wants to chop off all Christian heads and you and others side with these idiots.  Keep them the heck out of here or your going to end up like Sweden and Germany.

eng_test_2132	Considering the State of things in general, I would say these "Experts" are rather idiots and anything but experts. You would not trust them, neither would I and Trump is too smart to trust them not to undermine something along the way. They made their bed and now they get to sleep in it, outside in the cold like a homeless person. You win some and you lose some and sometimes you should keep your mouth shut if you want a job.

Another 14.7% are members of couples where the spouse is employed and earning more than minimum wage.  So, at most, 29% of minimum wage earners are the "primary breadwinner(s) of the family", and that figure includes couples were both spouse work for minimum wage and couples were one spouse is self-employed (so wages can't easily be calculated).
eng_test_2136	Be patient...some evidence might not be ready to be introduced. Similar to the Nixon investigation that took a long time. It's like gather everything to make the case then as one poster keeps posting ...KABOOM!
eng_test_2137	Such an intelligent statement.  Shows the level of your intelligence. Like most phony conservatives, you are just out to lunch!  Stupid is what  republicans are.

Real unifying stuff.  The Bircher thing, that's got legs. Trumpism -- protectionism, isolationism, distrust of anything not them -- is very reminiscent of Bircherism.
eng_test_2139	What is fake news?  Must be your reply.  Soros money spent is well documented,and the #1 talk show host is Rush.
eng_test_2140	It's quite possible to be duly elected, and an imposter. The proof is Trump. His ignorance, incompetence, corruption, lack of leadership traits all show his imposter status.

eng_test_2147	I'm gonna explain the issue here to you, and the other Liberal paid hacks and sockpuppets here.  The fundraisers are not illegal. No one has said they are. Yes, the CPC and others held them as well. Again, no one is saying anything to the contrary.  The problem here is the Liberals are openly flouting the PM's own guidelines he set out for the conduct of government Ministers.  The other problem is the Liberals are too arrogant to admit it and deal with it.....  ....and paid hacks like you are too blind and stupid to see it.
eng_test_2148	Hillary, herself, was the biggest reason for Hillary losing.    Americans are not nearly as stupid as Hillary and her loving, apparently partly blind, supporters would have you believe.

Yes, there is sexism - including those supporting Hillary simply because she is a woman -  but for most Americans there is simply not enough sexism to explain Hillary's loss, just lots of Hillary.

eng_test_2150	Young Canadians could pay dearly for Liberal spending?  No - young Canadians WILL pay dearly for Liberal spending. Just as we continue to pay today for Trudeau Sr's wild spending in the 1970s.
eng_test_2151	Just print our own money, close all private owned banks and finance companies, make interest rates illegal, make politicians wages no more than whatever the average Canadian makes, then make sure we take fundraising and donations out of the political system altogether. Finally... just get rid of the party system. It's too divisive and creates a distraction so the rich can continue to own and control the government and the incredibly gullible and ignorant citizens.

eng_test_2155	I am reminded of Martin Luther King's "Letter From A Birmingham Jail". I am particularly reminded of this paragraph:  We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was "well timed" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word "Wait!" It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This "Wait" has almost always meant "Never." We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that "justice too long delayed is justice denied."  Substitute "homosexual" for "Negro", and it rings true in this situation.

eng_test_2160	Most of them are too stupid warbirds. Try and get someone to admit to voting for Trudeau now, they won't but just like Wynn you had the slick commercials and the dumbos fell for it with people like Alceste posting his propaganda on this forum.
eng_test_2161	Basically if Trump says someone else is doing something wrong like his comment "the election is rigged you know he is the one doing it. If he says he is not doing something, he is. Now we all know his tricks and his is doing everything he can to try to bury the story with his Russian connection and the election. The longer the Republicans support Trump the harder they will all fall. I just it happens sooner then later.
eng_test_2162	If I'm reading this right, the primary impact on subsistence hunting would be non-subsistence hunters going into the area.    As we see signs along other roads "Subsistence hunting only", I'm not sure why that would be an issue that couldn't be handled by hunting  regulations. I would be more concerned with spending state money to build something for the benefit of a single company that resides in Canada.   Make them pay for it 110%

eng_test_2169	I have a theory why people are so stupid in these days. For about 30 years the government instructed people to cut out fat from our diet. Replace it with Carbs. Sugar. The population has gotten sicker and fatter. But also more stupid. So here it is. The brain is basically fat and protein. Exacly what most people don't eat anymore. So if they don't eat what the brain needs it can not develop. There it is I got the problem figured out. Eat more Moose and Salmon.

Trudeau has no proof he’s done anything good for Canada - he wants pot legalized - what the hell is that all about?  He wants more refugees and those who walk across the boarder he doesn’t send them home - are they part of the “unemployed” ?  Selfies, stupid look on his face (cause he knows he knows squat).

eng_test_2209	Another significant factor delaying discharge: the funding process for home care, assisted living, or skilled facility care. Once a patient is ready to transition (or very close), many patients need to apply for specific insurance to cover that kind of care, which is not automatic under most plans. (Just because it was considered medically necessary by a multidisciplinary team doesn't mean it was covered... but your hospital stay? That's definitely decertified now, because the team is recommending transfer to a different level of care.) The state can take 30 days to review that application once all the materials are pulled together - and it essentially -always- takes 28-30 days.  Assisted living and skilled nursing applications aren't reviewed until that funding is in place as they are in no position to hold beds indefinitely. This leads to a 2-4 week extension of hospital time on these stays, & it's not something anyone wants.

And, everytime you try your hand at supporting that monster, you identify yourself as with him, a believer, supporter, advocate and enabler of all those things.    A Trumpist, given to Trumpism, and therefore a supporter of racism, narcissism, elitism, sophistry and misogyny.  I know what it looks like when I see it on the TV.  It's ugly.  It has orange hair, flappy jowls, and a comical facial expression of attempted "toughness" that comes across as lame and buffoonish.  Look in the mirror.  That's what else it looks like.  Equally as ugly.  The ripples in the water don't help.
eng_test_2213	The "Food Babe" is controversial for one reason, and one reason only - she's a moron who will say anything, regardless of how ridiculously wrong it is - to sell her products.  For example, this is a woman who once said that air on commercial planes is bad for you to breathe because airlines "pump in" 50% nitrogen (which she implied was too much) in the air, which she claimed caused all sorts of bad effects.  Nevermind that the air we breathe at sea level is made up mostly of nitrogen.  She's a scientific moron.  That's why she's controversial.  She's an idiot and a liar.  Her name would more accurately be "Food Idiot."
eng_test_2214	Check your facts. Only the administrative assistants get more coin than the private sectors. Most Federal Public Servants are underpaid compared to the private sector. The only gold plated benefits are for the politicians and MP's. Standard benfits for the public service have been cut and they all pay the same as the private sector (some of the private sector get much better benefits) at 50/50 for the pension. One would hope people would say, hey those benefits are pretty good, I want them to in the private sector. Most large companies have similar benefit plans.
eng_test_2215	Obviously, nobody has the perfect answer to all of Chicago's needs [or the needs of any other diocese].

eng_test_2217	We cannot go back to unrestrained Judicial discretion. Discretion was proven by science and experience to be biased and discriminatory. I am sure that we do not want to go back to the days where we have a disproportionate number of natives in our jails and prisons. Oh right we still do, don't we? Second, bail was used to discriminate against the poor and minorities.  Bail was and still is, as implemented, unconstitutional and out of control. Judges still add unconstitutional bail conditions aka 24 hour sight and sound 3rd party custodians and so much more. Bail should be based on risk of flight balanced with ability to pay and severity of the charge. Most bail and bail conditions are outrageous but most defendants lie about their ability to pay. Therefore, the most weight should be on flight risk. In Alaska flight risk is minimal for most offenses (for many reasons). Bail should be minimal as a result.

A precedent was then set in 1988 for the Japanese Canadians "compensation". The Japanese Canadians received an apology and $21,000 in compensation, which should be good enough for Mr. Khadr, considering that not one of the interned Japanese Canadians took anyone else's life.
eng_test_2242	m:  You know better.  Carryover spending - absolutely.  President Obama campaigned on ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  (reducing expense), closing Gitmo (reducing expense) and did neither (maintaining expense) and expanded the war into Syria (increasing expense), not to mention the increased spending caused by Medicaid expansion and the ACA.  To be fair many of the things President Obama did were helpful however he came up short on his promise of "hope and change".  People are tired of the status quo (well maybe not you but many are) and the result is President Trump.

eng_test_2267	A climate change study was conducted by MIT in April 2016, titled 'How much of a difference will the Paris Agreement make?'. "The research showed that if countries abided by their pledges in the deal, global warming would slow by between 0.6 degree and 1.1 degrees Celsius by 2100, Reuters reported."  Wow! A 1% slowing down of global warming after 80 years!  In other words, it would make a tiny difference.  THAT'S "IF COUNTRIES ABIDED BY THEIR PLEDGES IN THE DEAL!"  A non-binding agreement that has no teeth.  Let's see, I wonder how many countries would keep their promises when nothing would happen if they didn't.  I would bet the U.S. would be one of the stupid countries that actually kept or tried to keep their promises while the rest of the world laughed at us.

I am selling oil and gas investors like APACHE to hire Alaskans and produce more oil but the state & the big  oil monopoly ran them out with bad rules and agency actions, so sad!!   I will keep selling oil and gas drillers on investing in Alaska, because the people are great and the oil and gas geology is the on f the best places in the world!! I love Alaska!!
eng_test_2274	"We worried that Trump administration political appointees would block the Fish and Wildlife Service from protecting any species" Just had to have at least one negative Trump statement in the article didn't you?As if Trump is against all wildlife. Just silly.
eng_test_2275	McCain calling Trump impulsive ???  That's rich. Johnny is still suffering from Stockholm Syndrome.  After Obama bitch slapped him 2 weeks in to his first Reich, telling him to sit down and shut up, because he lost.
eng_test_2276	I strongly agree with your last 2 sentences, Mr.O'Donnell.
eng_test_2277	This gets much closer to a truth than Casper does. I get it -- I just think it is poor tactics.  Call me naive, but I still believe that the average open-minded American believes we have a framework for progress, (e.g., bill of rights), and when people stop believing in the flag and the anthem, we have nothing.  Anarchy.  Anarchy never benefited the poor and downtrodden. The people marching to oppose racism and other forms of injustice should wrap themselves in the flag, not oppose it.  That was the genius of MLK.
eng_test_2278	Excellent straw man. Get everybody yakking about the finances, completely dismissing or ignoring the very real threat underground. The sites could be a cluster of Burj Khalifa-sized derricks, and still not be as "obtrusive" as the damage to the environment happening below the surface.  Yes, I'm one of those, not emotionally, but logically - if one of us sh*ts the nest, we all stink.

eng_test_2293	"Generally speaking, differences of opinion are best discussed when one sticks to the subject at hand."  The median income of the Hillary supporter is $10k less than that of Trump. Education is considered the key to success.

Something doesn't quite compute. But then again, I'm just dumb and affluent - what do I know?

eng_test_2301	LOL!!  When you have nothing on Trump and want to stay in the media, get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich!  The only reason this charade continues is because they are conducting REAL investigations of Hillery, Uranium 1, Rice, Obama, Lynch, Comey, the FBI, the unmaskings, etc.  This today came out after they called for a special prosecutor yesterday on the democrats listed above.  That is where the real Russian story is....Hillery, cash$ and Russian bribery.  The dems are so worried that they are being caught all over the place now as more emails are found (another 1,600 yesterday on Hillery that showed her attempting to bribe others), that it is comical!   Everything the dems did with Russia is what they are trying to dump back onto Trump.  Have at it, morons, you ain't seen nothing yet!  Trump is going to beat them down again.  This is just the beginning folks!  Get the popcorn ready!! In the end it will be the democrats and Clinton, et al, that go down the swamp-drain in DC!

What a joke, those louvered doors have been around since day one. It's a good thing he retired if he didn't see those doors. Just like all the others inspectors who didn't see the louvered doors either. Probably why they can't find the cause of the fire.
eng_test_2305	oldgit those small businesses need to invest in their business.  Maybe not that particular year so if you plow the money into RRSP's as you suggest or Morneau is suggesting you will be penalized for withdrawing RRSP's when you need to use that money for investment. When Gov't employees taxes go to pay for defined pensions for those business owners like the taxes do from the business owners go to pay for the defined pensions of Gov't employees then we can talk "fairness".

eng_test_2314	I disagree. I look to the divided United States, and the corrosive partisan discourse that permeates every decision they take.  Because there are many ways to make an electoral system more representative, and each country does it a slightly different way, the level of functionality varies. Most countries with more representative systems than ours function well. Countries like Italy, maybe not so much, but they are distinctly in the minority.
eng_test_2315	Check the history of CA.  The first legislature was dominated by Dems, and except for a few exceptional candidates, it has remained so.  Yes, during the war years, with an influx of conservative voters, we accomplished great things.  But otherwise, it has been a socialist disaster.
eng_test_2316	Real mercy is recieved after acknowledging your sin, having firm purpose of amendment, and doing penance.   Fake mercy is telling someone they are too stupid/weak to achieve holiness so just carry on in your sin.
eng_test_2317	Yeah, but will the debates make any difference? - Every time Mr. Trump opens his mouth he looks like a 'damn fool' - But inexplicably Mr. Trump's polling numbers go up with every incognizant bloviation.
eng_test_2318	Actually, another incorrect observation.  As you will recall, the murders at the Quebec mosque were carried out by a white male Canadian who professed to like President trump.   So, I would guess he was a rightard idjit and not a leftard idjit at all.    Checkmate, pal.
eng_test_2319	We should definitely quickly revert to an immigration mix that reflects our 1980s-90s population makeup like before, very logical. We need to move away from diversity, it's gotten way out of hand. Reduce immigration labor supply so Canadians get the better paying jobs and aren't bypassed by employers. People should visit Kellie Leitch's website and buy an inexpensive membership today.
eng_test_2320	In the debates, Clinton is going make Trump look like a damn fool.
eng_test_2321	Not only did Corn detail his meeting with a “former western intelligence officer” who is obviously Steele and quote extensively from a document that is obviously the Fusion GPS dossier ( which Hillary claimed just days ago didn’t become public until January 2017), he also  provides proof positive that Harry Reid was in contact with both Comey and “top officials in the national security community”  in early August 2016 discussing details of the dossier  and demanding the FBI begin an investigation of the Trump campaign based on the information in the dossier. Obviously, the ink on the dossier had barely dried before Clinton‘s minions were working to spread it far and wide.  This, of course, was all giddily celebrated by the Clinton Circle in 2016 as the much anticipated “October surprise” promised by Reid.  In 2017, it is utterly damning.   I hesitate to call this tortured saga a dog and pony show because  I hate to cast dispersion on legitimate dog and pony shows throughout history.
eng_test_2322	Does anyone have an estimate of when the ill effects of the Tier 1 system that ended in 1997 will start to be less each year? That is, when Tier 1 beneficiaries die at a faster rate than start retirement?  Hmm, looking at http://www.oregon.gov/PERS/Documents/General-Information/PERS-by-the-Numbers.pdf There are 45,000 active and inactive Tier 1 members. 23,000 are eligible to retire. That's a big percentage! But 6,000 retire (from all tiers) per year on average.  To me, then it sounds like in the next 5 years we may see most of the Tier 1 employees retire. At that point, the number of Tier 1 retirees will decrease. It may take a few years beyond that for the guaranteed deficits to not overcome the decreasing number of retirees, so within a decade the pain might start to ebb? That's a long time. Maybe we should all hope for Trump's growth stimulus on near-full employment to cause skyrocketing inflation and higher returns from investments.

There were far too many "Bronco's fans" who jumped on the bandwagon because of Peyton or Tebow and because they have been winning 10-12 games a year. There were far too many NFL "fans" who just got into the sport because of fantasy football.   But as Trump has clearly exposed, these were never real NFL or Bronco's fans. Good riddance!

eng_test_2336	No, you just call them deviants and perverts.
eng_test_2337	Mr. Trump has chosen to manufacture a problem that doesn't exist inside a private business.  He's doing this, again, to deflect attention away from the fact that his administration is a failed mess.  His sad supporters and sycophants are easily distracted, and this is the latest shiny ball to roll by them.  It doesn't seem to dawn on his supporters that Trump is an infantile failure.  Now he has picked a fight with black athletes, and has additionally insulted their mothers.  Trump is a racist piece of garbage who is soiling the presidency and White House every day he remains in office.  Worst President Ever.  By a wide margin.

Chinese communist don’t represent China’s centuries-long history or any past ruined dynasties of China. Chinese communist party which was founded only four years after as governed the People’s Republic of China from the republic’s founding in 1949 until today.

I am here to defend my father and his legacy against TROLLS like you. Think what you want about me, my father, the Alison family, at the end of the day it means nothing and your words are noise. I will always be loyal to him, I might not agree with everything he was doing in his life but I would only express that to him in private. Don't you worry about me Mr. Cleanup Eugene.

If your moral compass cannot tell you what is wrong and right you have no business dealing with public business. Slavery was legal, it was illegal for two races to marry, woman could not vote legally, in some states you could beat your wife legally. Bribery is legal its called lobbying, it is legal for President Trump to benefit from being President but is it just?  $800 on two pairs of glasses? Collecting public money at a publicly subsidized cafeteria and then pocketing the money is legal but, not okay with any one out side of Juneau. Kelly what you are doing is bullshit not reporting it.

But the cake has to be Anchorage Christian Schools giving money away that parents pay in tuition and make kids sell chocolate to help keep cost down, shame on you, shame.
eng_test_2359	Idiots, I am unsure, but don't understand statistics, most probably, yes.  As a country, we don't do a great job at education, especially on things like statistics, we are also kinda lazy when it comes to finding out facts.  People hear that a candidate won a poll, but don't take the time to look at by how much and what the margin of error is.
eng_test_2360	The level of scrutiny you advocate should be required of all real estate purchasers. They should have to prove that Canadian income taxes (or taxes in kind, in a country with a tax agreement with Canada) have been paid on all the money that is being brought to the purchase. This includes "gifts" from family members or other "supporters."  If such evidence isn't produced, levy an annual property tax rate equal to one-third the value of the purchase. In other words, a rate that seriously discourages dumping of untaxed wealth. Purchasers who can prove that they have paid their fair share of taxes on their wealth receive a "normal" property tax rate. Everyone knows that foreign capital is wrecking housing and land affordability, and, as the article confirms, this money can continue to find ways into the market by proxy through "non-foreign" buyers. The solution is to link real estate purchases to income tax. Demand that fed., prov. and municipal gov. cooperate to make it happen.
eng_test_2361	C'mon henry.  You're too predictable.  Antifluoridationists often start out smug, because they've done their "research" and know what the worldwide body of respected science and healthcare has somehow overlooked.  They post a comment or two, some junk they've copy/pasted from "fluoridealert" or some other little anti site, maybe a link to a study  title posted on the anti site, having, of course, not one clue as to what is in the study. . Then after having their head handed to them a couple of times, being exposed as the uninformed copy/paster that they are, they get frustrated and start googling me where they find nonsensical pieces written by antifluoridationists, the "Crescent City" comedy being one of their favorites, and post links to them, as if I, or anyone else, care one iota.  After that, they'll post another idiotic comment or two, then after being totally humiliated, will post a parting shot and disappear. . Thanks for the entertainment!! .  Steven D. Slott, DDS

eng_test_2377	Actually, the Mayor of San Juan is a more experienced elected official and public servant than Donald J. Trump.   She held her first press conference on the afternoon of the hurricane after herself having accompanied City officials making preliminary assessments of the damage, and specifically addressed the total obliteration of the housing built along the Martin Pena Canal.   She is absolutely right in pointing out that the island is only 100 miles by 35 miles, and that by now, basic relief supplies (water, fuel, food) could and should have reached any point on the island by appropriately sized military helicopter.   She is showing better, smarter leadership than the thin skinned, sociopathic Trump.

eng_test_2390	Ms. Adams, granted I am not a marine biologist, but I am a Ph.D. astrophysicist and I know my way around technical papers and how to contact the authors of those papers.  Have you read the referenced papers? I have and my statements are based on those readings.  As I keep writing, they are not applicable to the west-side beach because the geology is considerably different, and I confirmed this difference by contacting one of the authors.  They knew of no studies of beaches like the west-side beach.  As  for the trampled tidelands of the "rocky shore" variety studied in the papers, the studied trampling was much greater that what would be experienced at the west-side preserve.  Even then, one of the papers quoted nine months as a sufficient amount of time for the biological communities to recover.  Finally, the west-side beach is heavily affected by wave action during storms.  The resultant grinding of the upper tidelands is not condusive for macroscopic life - look at the beach.
eng_test_2391	" .. Multinational corporations, free trade and globalization benefit the financial elite and not us.."

eng_test_2397	"Impossible" is a pretty extreme response. B12 is recommended but it's not absolutely necessary. And as another post mentioned, even if it was absolutely necessary, having to take a B12 every couple of days is a small price to pay for the benefits of eating vegan. Besides, I know very few people who don't take some sort of multivitamin or at vitamin D in the winter. And let's continue this discussion when you're having to take lipitor for your cholesterol. I'm not saying anyone has to eat vegan but this is a pretty weak counter argument.

eng_test_2403	Time to channel my inner Nostradamus... repealing the Indian Act will result in the following:  FN refusing to give up anything they already have from it.  Money, benefits, special protected statuses... The Libs will engorge the funds so that even more billions flow from taxpayers to FN... There will be the same standard (ie none) of accountability. "Canadians" will, in writing, officially and legally accept blame for all wrongs of other peoples' ancestors thus ensuring FN have legal recourse to keep asking for more.

eng_test_2407	Your comment reminds me of those signs posted in some public parks or outdoor restaurants: "Do not feed the birds."  The reason they don't want us to feed the birds is that if we do feed the birds then lots more birds will come, dropping poop all over the place and ruining the ambiance.  Same concept goes for providing free food, shelter, medical care, etc. -- we become a magnet that attracts illegal immigrants and homeless people. Either our society must stop the welfare handouts, or else put up a wall so outsiders cannot come in to take advantage of our generosity that we intend for our own people.

eng_test_2412	I dare say there is. Though it occurred in the 1800's, hundreds of thousands of Americans on all sides lost their lives in the American Civil War. One doesn't have to be a racist to understand that a complex grievance of that magnitude doesn't disappear overnight.  Americans are to be admired for their attempt to honour both sides in their civil war. Arguably, it's what kept their country together and fostered its ascendance to where it is today.  To survive and prosper as a country, you have to acknowledge your past. By no means should you condone any historical abuses- instead they should be front and center and a lesson for all.

eng_test_2421	Yes, Klastri, right as always.  The event was promoted as a Free Speech Rally; there was nothing to indicated it was a pro-Trump, pro-Nazi or some such thing, yet you are confident that the 15,000 or more so-called “counter protesters” were there because Trump is a Nazi sympathizer.

Voting for Trump because the only option is Hillary doesn't make one a bigot.  It is a challenge to address our socio-economic-political world issues without using terms either too broad either too broad or too specific.    I wonder if there is a correlation between the lack of middle ground and the loss of the middle class.  From there it is a simple matter to turn the conversation to the topic of power /corruption, absolute power corrupts absolutely, the human condition . . .  Blahblah.  And now, back to JJ, where I could have left it in the first place.

Towards the end of the day we're sitting at our campsite and watch some guy on a quad go off the trail and go tearing through an untouched meadow. 4 of us went running down the hill to yell at him about it. The obligatory answer of "Sorry" came back. You could tell he didn't care, he just got caught.

Then, would you be prepared to offer up some kind of 'voter stupidity' measure, whereby we evaluate voter stupidity on some kind of international scale in order to identify 'smart outcomes of an election' VS 'stupid outcomes caused by stupid voters'?  Such a measure might be useful to politicians hoping to win in spite of voter stupidity and it might encourage tactics encouraging the stupid voters to just never mind voting because their stupid voting just gets in the way of the smart outcome.  OR, we all get one vote, stupid or not.

I, for one, am tired of people totally ignoring the findings of tens of thousands of scientists who have spent better parts of careers studying this stuff only to call it "BS" as if that was spoken from some higher authority.  That is truly BS.
eng_test_2515	What a glib and inaccurate description of the circumstances!   The Americans in the field were about to execute the wounded Khadr. Which is a war crime. At the last second they were advised to bring him back to base because he might be an intelligence asset. Then he was interrogated and tortured, which is also a war crime. Then he was incarcerated in a prison. Another war crime. Then he was put on trial. Which is a violation of the Geneva Conventions. Then he remained incarcerated long after hostilities had ceased. That's another violation.  You truly don't get it. The Americans- along with the Canadian government- grotesquely violated Khadr's rights as a child soldier/enemy combatant in multiple ways, including the use of torture. The only treatment worse than what he received would've been a battlefield execution. And it's only by the grace of God that didn't happen.

eng_test_2517	Haha!  I remember that. We used to see a great many up around Paxson  and you're right about them dive bombing you! Man, they meant BUSINESS!

eng_test_2520	I said I had it before Obamacare, and so did my daughters and their families. Now their premiums have gone up out of pocket cost skyrockets and deductibles have increased. All so someone else can get free healthcare. Even with that some of ones getting cheap insurance still can't afford the deductibles and out of pocket cost, so they still getting healthcare.
eng_test_2521	The Kelley family, sold their business interests (personal & real property) and most of their management influence, of the Outrigger Hotels & miscellaneous properties.  The Kelley family built their hotel wealth, during the Vietnam War era.  This local family, will no longer have an influence, with the Outrigger Hotels & miscellaneous properties.  Will the local people still have jobs, or, will outside labor & employees take over?
eng_test_2522	Sounds like the same crap all over again. I seem to remember Republicans saying the same thing about the ACA. Both sides need to grow up and work together.
eng_test_2523	Mitch McConnell's hypocrisy and sexism is blatant.  Telling a women basically to 'Sit down and shut up!' when he subsequently allowed 4 males to read the exact same document is shameful. Shameful but - sadly - typical of the GOP.  First they stole a seat on the Supreme Court and now their misogyny shows them to be the grand old chauvinist party they've always been.  Disgusting!
eng_test_2524	You told me once that 80% of your holdings were pipelines....and you used an advisor...and `he got 15% a year for 25 years. Of course all those old comments are now  no longer available...how inconvenient for us all. Meanwhile your suggesting that I  think I can influence the price of gold or NUGT  by my commenting .....??? Wow... a Cat with mighty powers indeed....or a mighty stupid or naive one.... or maybe none of the above.
eng_test_2525	Robert:  I rather agree with you.  The squabble over naming Kesey Square is, IMO, quite symbolic. Eugene does, indeed, have a national, even an international reputation of being a "liberal" community.  At the same time there are strong vested interests which control the economy of the region who are anything but liberal.  For the 46 years I've lived in the area these two community elements have be "co-existing"....bickering, fighting, hassling.....sure, like two kids sitting the the back seat on a long journey.  The Square will, I'm guessing, be officially named for Ken Kesey, the conservatives will whine, the liberals will gloat and the world will continue to turn.   C'est la vie.  Gary Crum
eng_test_2526	You complaining about smears? That's RICH! Ryan is the second most ineffective speaker. Boehner was the first. Neither could control their caucus. Pathetic.   Even more pathetic, Ryan lacks the balls to stand up to Trump. How will he ever stand up to Clinton?  The GOP is self destructing. It couldn't have happened to a nicer bunch.
eng_test_2527	And here I thought only the PM was an idiot.

eng_test_2531	"It's not in the bag. Trump has about a one in three shot at winning."  You might want to tell that to Steven Haycock, as well as many of your fellow pro-Hillary posters here, who have already and presumptively coronated, er, elected her, and already take her presidency as a given fact.  "Dewey defeats Truman!"
eng_test_2532	I wonder what the reaction would be if Obama had done this. The GOP would be screaming for impeachment I would think. Bob Weinstein has it right. They sit quietly back and pretend they didn't hear anything.

eng_test_2536	man you are ignorant,, obama said NO to over 300 pieces of legislation when they were not 100% his way! he never compromised, never, obama was the problem loser...and even when the dems controlled the house and senate in the first  2 years it was still his way or nothing, so even dems who said no, were bought off with goodies for votes ignoring the GOP 100% ,, if you dont pass legislation with out both sides ,including some from the minority side .,, the law is destine to be trashed, as so it should! and so shall obamacaree, TRASH

eng_test_2538	Phil, you are talking crazy. No one takes your money at gunpoint. You can see how crazy that is, can't you? A healthy nation is a happy and productive nation, a benefit to all of us, you can see that, can't you? We ALL pay taxes. There is nothing certain in life but death and taxes. I have no problem paying my taxes to run our great country, and some years, my taxes are more than the median individual wage. As I said previously, you don't understand the Constitution, and you don't understand our laws.  I would characterize you as a miser. Your resentment of others is a poison that is contaminating your life. Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, praise God, and enjoy the life that He gave you. We each have a short time on Earth, enjoy it!
eng_test_2539	This has been exhaustively investigated. There is no evidence that Clinton was at fault or could have saved anyone. You already know that, though. Paranto is making his living selling this story and perhaps he believes it.

eng_test_2542	Ummmm, there's this neat little tool on the internet called Google.  It's fascinating really.  You can literally look up anything.....anything!  Since you obviously don't understand how U.S. elections work, type this into the little search bar thingy......."How do United States elections work?"  See I even did the work for you.  Copy and paste if you like, I don't mind.  Wait, do I need to explain copy and paste to you?  Crap, not enough time.  When you're done reading about U.S. elections and how they work maybe you'll think twice about posting nonsense about popular vote.
eng_test_2543	great. now we gotta find stupid people with deep pockets to help finish this thing.
eng_test_2544	Again, you are also totally ignoring the reality of what was going on when this student sought medical assistance.  There was already a documented  outbreak of meningitis underway at the University of Oregon, when this student sought help.  The outbreak was the daily top headline for the Register Guard at that time, as well as being the lead story on our local TV News programs.  Common sense would have been to take that fact into consideration in treating her.    The medical staff that treated her were absolute idiots.
eng_test_2545	I see....so poorly educated person, regardless of his/her intelligence, is stupid by your standard, SE Slayer? Most of the 3rd World people must be stupid by your assessment? What a bigotry comment!!!

eng_test_2547	Putin is just getting started. Why do you think NATO is positioning missiles and troops in the countries that border Russia? No one trusts Putin. He is a lying, despotic, corrupt thug.
eng_test_2548	Maybe we shouldn't have spent the money on these fancy laser detectors and just used some flashlights in toilet paper rolls instead, and then waited for this collision of supermassive black holes a million years from now: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/science/in-a-far-off-galaxy-2-black-holes-dance-toward-an-explosive-union.html?_r=2  The black holes involved in the current study were actually pretty small (61 suns combined) compared to the supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies that may have masses up to billions of suns.
eng_test_2549	600 years since a Pope has resigned, and Benedict - who is no fan of change in the Church - resigns, with mental capacity intact, and we're supposed to believe it's just another day in the Vatican?  And then both he and the new Pope talk about a "gay mafia," and we're supposed to ignore that?  You don't need to be a conspiracy theorist to connect the dots.
eng_test_2550	Walker was completely wrong to do it this year.   If he were going to do it right it would have been implemented next year after going through all the correct avenues.      He's just desperate to put more money in his stupid and asinine and unobtainable pipeline project.
eng_test_2551	City councils large and small should stick to running their city or town.  Let the far left democrat party social justice warriors fight for every crazy movement that seems to pop up.  City councils need to keep taxes low and the streets fixed and take your leftist causes somewhere else.
eng_test_2552	O: There's the trapper's dodge - "keep your darn dog on a leash". Every year as dogs get killed or maimed, the trapper's blame the dog owner. I'd say don't set you land mines near my family in the first place.

eng_test_2556	Absolutely right that we need to QUIT wasting money on this.   And yet, you are backing an idiot that is wasting 10s, if not 100s, of BILLIONS on this illegal issue and solving NOTHING.  If we continue to go after individuals, there are 13-30 million illegals in America, with more coming every year. How many are we exporting?  Turns out that we deport less than .5M / year, while more than that arrive. Worse, we are spending 3.2B on this.   http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/13/news/economy/deportation-costs-undocumented-immigrant/index.html  And none of that includes his foolish wall. OTOH, if we figure out who will get passes here, and then phase in e-verify, it will cost us less than 1B / year, and will deport the 9-22 million that do not fit the above idea of amnesty. And most will be gone within 2 years. Those that remain will be easy and cheap for ICE to capture.  All at a fraction of the $. So, please stop backing criminals and wasteful fools.
eng_test_2557	Anybody who falsely claims to have been awarded a Nobel prize has a serious credibility gap in my book.  What is it with Liberal ministers who continually take credit for the accomplishments of others?

eng_test_2563	Really, larry k?  So no one is allowed to mention Trump's racist fans?  My First Amendment rights are intact.  If you want to protect this nation you would join the movement to impeach and imprison Trump for being an agent of Putin.
eng_test_2564	These are all deep state Obama cronies withholding the information! Will the last Democrat left who is not a thief, liar, or murderer, please stand up!
eng_test_2565	Jon, Trump has blamed Obama for not firing Comey. Just like he blamed him for Flynn.  Trump is an idiot who represents all of the idiots in this country.
eng_test_2566	This is ridiculous!  It was the Conservative Party that broke the law and violated his rights.  Why are we responsible?  It's time to start a petition to force the Conservative Party to pay all of this settlement.  This is about the law and those who broke the law.  The Conservative Party is guilty as hell, as per the Supreme Court ruling.  Hey Harper, get out your damn cheque book!!

Why change your reasoning? Why lie? He's like that ONE GUY you grew up with who CANNOT tell the truth. If he goes to Target, He'll say he went to WalMart. Weird. And it bugs me when members of congress defend his silliness. It makes them look weird. Just say the truth. "What happened, happened but we're not interested in impeachment over the matter..blah blah blah" But don't act like it wasn't said or you don't believe what it meant...it makes them look stupid and makes me think they think I'm stupid. And why?? Most of this president's troubles are ridiculous. He could easily stop them by closing his twitter account & sticking to a script. He's weird. No doubt.

eng_test_2573	That sucks,  but this bill won't make it better.
eng_test_2574	The 33% increase is the confluence of the factors he outlines coupled with very low mortgage rates creating a panic, the panic creating irrational bidding, multiple offers and silly prices.  Panics happen, I suggest you read the  Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the  Madness of Crowds by Mackay.  Still considered the sequential read on economic bubbles and panics.  Moat of the people at the showings and in these multiple bidding scenarios are not foreign investors, they may be local speculators.   Let's hope that Wynn's tangential policies stop the panic and things settle down.  Then we will see where prices go.
eng_test_2575	Over the next few weeks I will be asking friends if they still plan to vote for Trump. If any of them say yes, I will be surprised because I usually don't hang around with racist, homophobic, pigs.  I have spent some time in various locker-rooms and have never heard anyone suggest they enjoyed sexually assaulting women. His response last night was pure BS.  I would not let that fat orange pig near my house, my family, or our Presidency!

If culture and language are important to a group of people, their culture and language will be a way of life, something lived everyday, and it will thrive on it's own.

On the bright side PM Simpleton has demonstrated to all of Canada that legislation passed by a sitting government can be quickly repealed by the next government.

I think the most effective R&D at this point, will be that of the companies fighting for their place in the market. The best way to support them is through direct consumer subsidies that allow individuals, communities, cities and provinces the freedom to decide for themselves what the best product is and to defray some of the costs and risks of early adoption.
eng_test_2593	The noose is slowly tightening around Trump's neck as the best defense that his supporters seem to be able to come up with is that because he's a "new guy" and he's stupid.

The mayor received 4 paid trips to China to try to get this deal. Then he tried to slip it through council with 1 sheet of paper, hoping no one would notice. Before the Conservation Authority changed leaders, they were replacing regular citizens on their board with regional councilors that were pro-development.

eng_test_2600	Mr. Trump's values as an individual and a businessperson have always reflected his demonstrated belief that life is a "zero sum" game.....if something benefits You it is a detriment to Me.....and, conversely, if I'm to benefit, by definition, it will have a cost to You.  His every action as President reflects his applying this very set of values to the office:  to economic policy, to social and environmental policies, and to international relations.  As he promised in his campaign...it's all winners and losers.    Only 17% of Americans favor withdrawing from the Paris Pact, 61% favor continuing membership.  Mr. Trump was loyal to his narrow base of climate change deniers and chose to withdraw from the Pact.  This is yet another example that we have a President whose actions do not represent the desires of, or promote the welfare of all Americans and the rest of the world.    Yes I know.....HE'S THE PRESIDENT...Indeed, he is.....and we're paying the price of it.   Gary Crum

He'll say nice things about puerto ricans, then chide them with his totally unnecessary statement about help not being able to stay there "forever."

The difference is that he has gotten involved in a personal feud with that puerto rican mayor, and his narcissistic pettiness drives him to tweet these stupid things.

eng_test_2607	Sadly, Trump is the preferred leader of the GOP base of "poorly educated" white folks that he claims to love. He expresses their fear and rage. They are  terrified of losing the white privilege they claim does not exist. They are also the only demographic  in the country that is dying younger. They are killing themselves with drugs, alcohol, domestic violence, and suicides.  I would pity them if they didn't think killing black folks would solve their problems.

That together with the childish behavior of rioters in Portland after the election and the idiots at PDX after the announcement of the travel ban and the idiocy of Oregon's trisexual, or multisexual governor in her apparent attempts to codify statewide opposition to Pres Trump will place U of O and OSU at the very bottom of the list of federal grantees and contractors going forward.

eng_test_2629	When it is Bush's fault it is Bush's fault and the simplistic sarcasm of Mr. Wolf is just that and not worthy of a reply let alone an agreement as you did. You are better than to knee jerk agree with that kind of, yes, sophomoric crap Ms. Gegonos.

Dystopian  authoritarian paramilitary nightmare zombie, rise from your grave to populate well-reasoned living angst. Those aren't police stations, they're forward operating bases.

eng_test_2633	Spot on, Spenard.

eng_test_2636	Troll warning!  "News Flash from Wiki Leaks: Hillary Clinton 'hate[s] everyday Americans'".  -- Who let the dogs out?  This is been debunked completely.    "It was clear from the context of the email that Podesta was referring only to the phrase 'everyday Americans,' as he was discussing language for a speech Clinton was set to deliver in New Hampshire."  http://www.businessinsider.com/wikileaks-email-hillary-clinton-everyday-americans-2016-10  Next time try to understand that other folks aren't as stupid as you ... think.

eng_test_2639	How are the US Citizens rights violated with this ban?  Dr. Elshikh's mother-in-law was already petitioned which still has to be processed/vetted. Most countries have quotas to deal with too which can delay entry to the US!  They just need to wait their turn.
eng_test_2640	"Alexco, which specializes in cleaning up contaminated sites"  And they will throw in the Golden Gate Bridge for free!  All these companies do is to do the very least cleanup they can get away with (and that means lying, cheating and manipulating data to get the case "Closed" (always with a list of residual toxins longer than a medical prescription disclaimer).  Anytime the government bows to lobbying and allows this shell game for cleanup responsibility, the Public suffers from all the residual contamination.
eng_test_2641	Played a chess game at school  when we were bored on a Sunday. Called " Grub Schag " What it boiled down to was , if I present a piece to you on the board , you had to take it. Obviously the winner was the guy who had lost all his pieces first. Even in this game there were tactics.

eng_test_2648	king trump. Who rated him? I'm just asking that because historians don't rate a sitting president. They actually wait until he has left office to rate a president.

eng_test_2653	Trudeau has cut taxes - not a single tax has been raised  And yes  you do have to explain - because your comments make no sense.  Lots has been done in the past 2 weeks let alone the past year.  Your cryptic comments don't cut it with the general population.

eng_test_2657	No one is making money at these low prices and they want to change the the law and increase taxes, that is suicide!!  With HB 247 the drillers will stop drilling in Alaska and the state will suffer very badly!!  Alaskans and smaller competitors can’t drill and profit because the laws are too harsh and the system is rigged. It is time to fix it and prosper with more royalty income!  Alaska needs new ideas so here is one; simplify the permitting and do away with all tax and Alaska would have more drillers providing so much more production and money so all will be happy!!  Alaska has the oil wealth but it is locked up with bad rules and the majors monopoly, it is time to give Alaska back now!!  Alaskans can’t drill and profit under these current laws, that is why not one Alaskan has ever been able to drill and sell oil at a profit but many can’t realize the issues, why? Who will lead Alaskans, let them drill, fix the rules now!! We need these credits until laws enable Alaskans in!!! 777!!
eng_test_2658	Pathetic response. You did a lot more typing than "Yes."

eng_test_2667	Rob for sure raising kids, making ends meet are tough financial years and it gets worst today with daycare cost in ROC more than a 1000 bucks a kids, mortgages et al and wages that have not grown; unless you are working for the government. But you need to get real with this piece; there are two types of fixed income retired people. The haves and the have not's. The haves are the 25% of the work force with DB pensions (you know who they are, civil servants, bank employees, insurance companies etc but the number is dropping every year as companies get rid of this pension option) and the 5% who assumed wealth or made there own. The have nots are the rest of us, 580$ and change on OAS does not even pay the property tax on a small house in NB. CP well, a lot of have nots get a lot less than the 1200 or so the haves get, savings what are these to working people. My cost have gone up from the taxman taking more and more and I adjust, by consuming less so I do not end up in the poor house.
eng_test_2668	I'm guessing you'd be whistling a different tune if Wikileaks was out there revealing corruption and proving criminality from the RNC and Trump campaign? It's sad.

If you use debt to buy a skidoo, boat, TV, Quad, groceries etc, and add to it every year, you are an idiot.  If you do this all your life, and complain you can't retire at 55 and travel, you are a super idiot.  The government of Ontario falls into the super idiot catagory.

eng_test_2706	Trump’s Man   The thing about Rodrigo Duterte is that for an authoritarian like Trump, he says things that Trump would like to say himself but can’t yet.    And you know President Pussy Grabber loves this.  Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte joked Friday that soldiers could rape up to three women, as he reassured them of his full support under his newly imposed regional martial law.  Given that Duterte responded to the rape of his own daughter by calling her a “drama queen,” such horrible inhuman statements are hardly unusual.    And this is why Trump loves the guy. Perfect guy to share some sexist jokes and the location of our submarines.

Feel free to say the agency completely bungled the tracking, but it's disgusting to claim that our national police force, in attempt to slow the supply of guns through the border, were 'gun running' for profit.   What the hell was their motive?  I feel terrible for the men who were murdered.   Their family, in grief, can't call them hero's for dying at the hand of DRUG RUNNERS, because sanctimonious partisan agents, needed to score points on the Admin.   That's unpatriotic and totally lacking in compassion.    Hypocritical that the far right always says gun's aren't the problem it's the people holding them.   Yes, we lost track of the weapons (how may traded in gun shows later cause death and injury?), but the murders were the people holding the weapons, not employee's of the US government.  How many weapons left behind in the ME?

eng_test_2726	Yeah it doesn't quite work that way. And most of you're refined product come through in batches through the TransMountain pipeline. It is then 'cleaned up' to remove any contamination from the batches, i.e. batch 1 gasoline, batch 2 diesel batch 3 jet fuel batch 4 crude oil. And the diluent that is used may be condensate (almost gasoline like) or syntethic crude oil or even paraffinic diluted bitumen. The latter is refinery ready (assuming they can process heavy oil) and is different from the dilbit everyone gets os excited about.  http://www.oilsandsmagazine.com/technical/mining/froth-treatment
eng_test_2727	gary - Trump qualified his response with ...... "if he felt the election was rigged against him".  Why did you leave that out???  gary - What was Hillary's answer to that same question from Chris Wallace?    Both candidates concluded the first presidential debate by saying they will accept the outcome if the other wins.  Trump finished his answer by saying that if Clinton wins, “I will absolutely support her.”  But that was before damning evidence of the DNC rigging the primary election came out.  I guarantee you that if Trump wins and Clinton thinks the election was rigged in any way, she will contest the results.  You know that, but you will never admit to it because of your extreme partisan bias.
eng_test_2728	I guess the free market is a bad thing according to Trump.  The Republican party need to change it's platform to crony capitalism now and forever, we will pick the losers and winners. Current winner will be coal and corn ethanol.  Losers will be the environment.
eng_test_2729	Bunch of inefficient goons.

eng_test_2731	IPublius, you're arguing at the level of abstraction and sound a little bit like Ayn Rand. No one is advocating a national plan for re-distribution of hole-digging and homework-doing resources. Your logic is faulty because in cases where potential for human suffering is involved, it's different. I think you know this.

eng_test_2733	It's not racist to shun people who believe apostates and blasphemers against Islam should be killed. It's not racist to notice Muslim women never (or hardly ever) marry a non-Muslim. If this is how you live and what you believe then don't blame society for not liking it.
eng_test_2734	Based upon the videos I've seen the Boy Scouts of America would love to see Trump Make America Great Again

eng_test_2736	When schools close, the properties get sold off - but those properties - land and buildings, are a key part of the local community and it means a loss of green space.  Her's an idea - transfer school boards to the cities and counties to ensure oversight and that these bodies work together - school buildings can house libraries, daycare centres etc. and can serve as community hubs.  School boards would have 50% of their members elected by voters, and the rest appointed by the city/county and maybe another means would be to have parents of students or (children soon to enter school) elect people to serve on local parents boards.
eng_test_2737	This man is disgusting...he has milked his military service for 30 years and lived off the gov teat...retire and just pass away in peace.  He has never gotten over getting a$$ kicked by obama

eng_test_2739	And the biggest joke are people lining up in their F150s having a smoke or two while waiting 5 or so min to get to the checkout.   Never ceases to amaze me.  I once asked a person while gettng my bike ready to ride, why they are in the drive through as there were over 15 cars in the lineup. Their response while lighting up a smoke was inside was just as bad.  I rode by the front window and there were two people inside. I returned to the Ford F150 and mentioned this to the driver.  Just a dull vacant look on her face.
eng_test_2740	Hahaha, its better than saying Hillary is an example for women. "Look girls, to win anything you need to cheat. To get what you want you need to steal.

eng_test_2741	What a disgusting comment from a troll hiding behind a pseudonym
eng_test_2742	my you are a complete lib lunatic of stupid
eng_test_2743	Yes, defintely speaking about death, killing oneself and the various ways society leaves one in a position where death is the only way out of suffering is a fact we need to deal with more robustly. Too many are ignorant and stupid when you talk about thesethings saying you need emotional, mental health - uhm no there's no way, so stop the BS:  either provide a way to live or provide a way to die. That's it, period. Enough with the idea we are all slaves and thus must stay alive in order for someone else to profit! It is vile and evil. No more!
eng_test_2744	So was I. You're a liar and until proven other wise, you'll remain one. You wouldn't last 30 seconds in a room with Ken before you'd start crying and call your mom for a ride home.

So now, with mail-in voting starting today (half of likely votes to be cast, based on past results), local GOP political resources should probably be shifted to state legislative races, 1 or 2 city council races, and redirecting Hawaii volunteers to make phone calls to voters in key battleground states to help defeat Hillary.  For GOP leaders Hellreich, Rohlfing, Marumoto and Saiki to continue wasting party resources to help push Djou over the finish line is financially irresponsible.

eng_test_2760	"Ethnicity," please.  "Race" is an artificial construct, and technically there is but one race...the human race.  As for political vs. religious beliefs...that one is a little more sticky, I will admit that.  We do have separation of Church and State in this country...thus, our laws are not supposed to be affected or influenced by religious institutions (I'll wait while you stop laughing).  Religious beliefs revolve around the idea of a Supreme Being or Supreme Beings or whatever...yes, there are "moral codes" and such, but the core of it is belief in an unseen higher power.  Political beliefs revolve around how we are supposed to act within a civilized society, how we are to treat our fellow citizens, how we choose to punish those who behave in what we have collectively deemed to be a criminal manner...and all of that is - ideally - meant to be accomplished separate of religious influences.  I have a lot more to say on this, but I'm running out of allotted space here.

Now the naively stupid voted in your boy to finish the job.
eng_test_2812	You are so wrong. What you didn't learn about Alaskan Natives is that many of our ancestors DIED because of the invasion of western civilization. This is what the government didn't want to teach you in schools. There were slaves, there were people held captive, there were diseases, the government took away their culture, their lifestyle, everything. You are so ignorant, it's sad to see people not know anything about the real Alaskan Native History. Now we have people like you.

eng_test_2815	This was an excellent opinion piece:  very clear, sensible, and full of detail.  I was not aware that so many residents spent such a high percentage of their income on housing.  Thank you for that information.  That unfortunate situation could get much worse in the future, as you suggest.  As more people migrate to Eugene and compete for the limited housing stock, housing prices and rents should increase unless the supply also increases to keep pace.  It seems pretty obvious that one solution is sprawl, but a much better solution is a vibrant, beautiful, walkable, more populated neighborhood that has a real pulse, character, and energy to it.  I bet millennials and Gen zers in Eugene would overwhelmingly agree, and they are the ones for whom we should be planning this City's future.
eng_test_2816	It's basic human nature and economics that the rich, their bought-and-paid-for politicians and anyone making money off of the current state of affairs, will defend the status quo and try to protect their investments. That is the only reason that the Republicans and the one percenters care in any way about the environment, because they don't want their applecart upset.  Change the equation and let them be losing money because of global warming and they will soon be on the other side of the debate, screaming for a halt to the effects of the human race. The simplest path to understanding any problem today is "Follow the money!"
eng_test_2817	The Canadian government refuses to acknowledge that there is massive income tax evasion going on among the immigrant oligarch families living in multi-million dollar homes in the Toronto and Vancouver areas. I guess it is afraid to burst the bubble that is propping up house prices in those areas.
eng_test_2818	You can't even lie very well. Basically, you disagree with me, then you have to go further to outright insult me. Does that make you feel good?   That guy GBA goes out of his way to insult people. You're doing that too. I stick mostly to facts and opinions. I don't expect everyone to agree with my opinions. All this personal crap is just a distraction. Why in heaven's name are you upset when I say a person appears to be a decent looking person, not "a mess"? Why do you feel it necessary to taunt me about some imagined personal attraction? You are VERY juvenile, Judass.
eng_test_2819	Contrary to the headline, Anchorage does not face "grim" year if the mayor and assembly make wise choices with the funds available. Unfortunately, most likely politics will get in the way and the mayor's favorite progressive recipients of our tax dollars will deplete those dollars available for the common good. The dilemma facing the mayor is that without a self imposed financial crisis how can he justify the current tax burdens? Anchorage has a spending problem not a revenue problem.

eng_test_2825	Keep in mind that every manufacturer offers fairly economical 'base models' that almost no one buys.    When Musk introduced the Model 3 over a year ago, he said that the base model would be a great car, and it will be.  It will include all the important safety features enabled at no extra cost.  It will have the same Supercharging capability as the higher end models, and it will have over-the-air updates capability.  Additionally, it will come with all the hardware installed needed for full autonomy in the future, including very expensive computing hardware.  However,  like all model levels , when that hardware becomes fully operable through software updates and regulatory approvals, it will cost the owner to fully enable it  I agree that many people will choose to pay more for premium features.  However the base model will be well worth the base price of $35,000.

eng_test_2846	Personally, when ACA was enacted I hoped for the best but prepared for the worst.   We ended up with a 52% increase in premiums and while attempting to work with the Exchange we did not viable options so we ended up paying an additional ~ $500 per month.  We were not fortunate enough to have medical coverage subsidized by the government as employee (those making these decisions) or a recipient of subsidy.  This "premium" is really  monitored by the IRS (it is a described as a "shared responsibility"... tax liability").  For those who opt not to pay this "tax" it will become a "tax liability".  So aside from us locally having to have the albatross around our neck with the under funded ERS (~$23,000 per private sector tax payer) and the impending burden of funding the ACA (which Aetha has opted out of several states).  The ACA needs to be tweaked or repealed to "reasonably accommodate" both Makers and Takers.

eng_test_2852	The same weekend Trump signs his executive order, there was a major spill from a pipeline on a reservation in Western Saskatchewan.  Very few people know about this because Trump knows full well he must keep the news media's attention fully on him.  The Sioux leaders have asked that the camps be torn down and protesters gone by the end of this month.  This is a wise decision in the face of a president who threatened to 'send the feds' into Chicago.  The battle now moves to court rooms.
eng_test_2853	Well the Mueller Investigation must extend beyond collusion, because there was no collusion. They have to find something or it was a big waste of time, money and post election Democratic propaganda.  So, as I predicted months ago, some people would charged with tax evasion, money laundering, failing to register as a foreign agent. etc. but nothing related to collusion or Russian influence.  Tony Podesta did not register as a foreign agent either when he was paid to lobby for Russia's biggest bank for the removal of sanctions.

eng_test_2855	The tyranny of political correctness is inflicted on the citizens of the United States by liberals.  College campuses across the United States shut down dialogue, debate, and students interrupt invited guests from speaking out on any subject that ruffles their feathers.

Have you ever had someone with expertise (car mechanic, accountant, event speaker, professor, etc) talk above your level, knowing you’re not following, yet subtly daring you to expose your ignorance?  My experience has been that not accepting this behaviour at this level allowed me to practice the words &  emotions I needed when confronted by “ Weinsteinian’s”  throughout my life,  in and outside of work.
eng_test_2861	Putin is a communist and not a fascist.  But you are correct in that there is very little difference in communism and fascism; both want absolute state power and no individual liberty or freedom.

eng_test_2866	Well - good questions all - and unfortunately there is no right or universal God given answer. And I certainly do not pretend to have one. In the meantime this court spent $8B of money without demonstrable outcomes beyond embarrassing itself. Thus it is mere window dressing presenting a false picture about effective international law.   Perhaps it is time to admit that international law is rather ethereal - not reaching much beyond specific ( trade ) contract enforcement. And our future will be built better if we were to actually focus on the future, what it should be - and not drive into it looking at our rear view mirrors.   Lastly given our extensive multiplicity of cultures, legal systems, power politics ...  it is naive to expect short term solutions. A more strategic aproach is called for - probably generational time frames.
eng_test_2867	What happened sucks, Teddy.  Can't believe your original post was deemed unworthy by some self-appopinted arbiter of civility since it was both insightful and civil, but you aren't alone -- it's happened to me, too.  Great Dief story...thanks for sharing.
eng_test_2868	Does anyone other than the FBI know everything that's in the dossier. Does anyone other than the FBI know what other information the FBI has on Trump and any contacts he or his staff had with the Russians? Does anyone know what information Mueller has that the FBI doesn't have? Until the answers to those questions are known, the investigation should continue.  The American people should know what, if any business dealings Trump has with the Russians. Remember, Trump still owns his business.

eng_test_2870	How long America?  Trump is a disgrace.  No one can defend this traitorous buffoon, there is no defense for him, there never was.  You people who voted for him?  You should be ashamed.  You've got blood on your hands already from the deaths Trump has caused.  He may kill millions.  He very well could start a war because you were irresponsible enough to place a mentally deficient buffoon in power.  Call and write your Representatives and ask them to impeach Trump.  You owe it to the world to make it happen.
eng_test_2871	Now you're going to get five years for escape and you are not going to serve it at Waiawa. What an idiot.
eng_test_2872	"The ocean waters may be getting warmer, but has nothing to do with us"...... 95% of people way smarter and more informed than you and I disagree. Climate change is caused by too much carbon in the atmosphere. I'm siding with the smart people....

eng_test_2875	When Harry goes to church he sits in his pew and points out to himself that liberal is a liar, that one is a racist and says amen when the pastor says a prayer to love thy neighbor.  . Have a wonderful Christian life Harry.
eng_test_2876	You just won the dumbest comment of the day IMO.
eng_test_2877	More evidence that sending Mr Airbus Mulroney to Washington to defend our interests was a complete and utter waste of time.  But, who else could that have sent.  I mean, after all,  JT has no heft and would be flicked off like a fly.  Give our softwoods to China gratis. After all, they are taking over most of BC
eng_test_2878	Can't have paper ballots. Then you would have those chads to deal with when the Democrat candidate loses.
eng_test_2879	What makes you believe that it is a matter of intolerance?  That it has anything to do with the former religion of the rotting human corpses?  Nothing except quotes from a bunch of Chicken Littles so much as infers that.
eng_test_2880	You keep blaming Harper. Please that idiot Trudeau has been in power fro close to 2 years now, and other than spending massively for nothing, he has accomplished nothing, "Gerard tell me what to do".
eng_test_2881	You're an IDIOT which was proven yesterday!! You idiotic gun control nuts want gun control? Don't allow DEMOCRATS to have guns!! Every mass shooter has been a DEMOCRAT!

eng_test_2883	It would take a lot of practice and muscles control to vote with your vagina.
eng_test_2884	There may never be a solution. Reasons are many. One reason? Let's say the gov. builds and provides homes ( rooms, apt., etc). So, Vancouver builds 350 units, perhaps? Ok. Great. For this year. Now, come next year, there will be 400 homless, VS 350 this year. Why? Because the word gets around. people will depend on the new housing. And, when you can spend ALL of whatever you get, and worry not about rent? So that, two years down the road, there will be another 100 homeless. Because? People will hitch hike to Vancouver. For a home. And, year after year, more and more will arrive. New units need to be built. And then even more. There is no end. So, the solution is first of all, and important, that housing is equally provided across the nation. This is a nation wide concern, after all. Perhaps? A never ending crisis.
eng_test_2885	Wow, if Trump and Scary are in any way examples of the typical American Wall Street business dweeb, the US has even more to worry about than just this current regime.
eng_test_2886	The Bundys have long been Latter-Day Saints.  They have no connection to polygamy that I am aware of.  The occupation of the Klamath Wildlife Refuge was officially and forcefully condemned - within a very few days of its beginning - by the senior leadership of the LDS Church.
eng_test_2887	I've been at Kincaid when a skier was stomped and injured by a moose. Since there was no cell coverage, another skier had to ski back to the chalet to call 911. There are hundreds of children in the park as part of Jr Nordic with coaches using cell phones to communicate about children who are cold, injured, or have become separated from their group. Safety is my primary reason for having a cellphone, and it is more important than the aesthetics of a internet free experience.

eng_test_2890	Rubbish.
eng_test_2891	No, but to think there is no cost associated with this change is wrong.  My point is if you feel strongly enough to change the name then you should be willing to pay the cost of the change.  Expecting someone else to foot the bill for this frivolous change is wrong.

eng_test_2895	Two Tone Trump has proved himself to be a Fantasy Prone Person, a Con Artist, a Fraud, and a Lowlife.  Now he is suffering paranoia - the world is out to get him - and delusions of grandeur -only he can save the world. Sooner or later, his supporters will have to realize that it is insane to fellow such an individual.
eng_test_2896	This is an easy one. The United States must ask permission to attack North Korea? What is he smoking. It is the United States since 1950 has kept their ass safe. Many good men died protecting their sorry asses. He must think his fecal matter does not stink. So let the United States do two simple acts. Pull out ALL TROOPS,AND MILITARY SUPPLIES,PROTECTION, AND SECOND QUIT FINANCIALLY SUPPORTING THEM. After all they are letting their alligator mouth over ride their tad pole ass. I for one am sick and tired of protecting those countries who clearly do not like us
eng_test_2897	Respectfully, this is by far the dumbest statement I have read all day.
eng_test_2898	I'm glad someone still knows what 'socialized medicine' entails.
eng_test_2899	If they mean 11% more than the 36.5hrs, it would be 40.515 hrs, at $445 a week, so still less than what they're now making.  If it were 11% more than 40 hrs, then it's 44.4 hrs and $488, so a bit more than they're making now.  However, most minimum and near minimum wage companies try really hard to stay at or below 40 hrs a week as overtime kicks in.
eng_test_2900	No I didn't and you lied to say that I had posted it more than once in this article of the topic. Do not even dare tell me what to do or what I can say. Your audacity to even suggest that you can is beyond pathetic, petty and unworthy of respect. You are a scam artist and you have the choice to skip over my posts.  Trying to control the message will only make it backfire ten-fold on you.
eng_test_2901	Good god, who actually still thinks this. Give me a break, this is just utterly stupid.
eng_test_2902	Oh great, more trash from Illinois.  And of course, to the LEOs involved, good job arresting this criminal. You do a hard job that none of your critics have the onions to even attempt.
eng_test_2903	Shhh! You're not supposed to say "ban". (Even though the Trumpster Himself does.)
eng_test_2904	Andi, without those two scumbags, guns would have harmed no one and Precious would be alive. Plenty of people get killed with other weapons. When people want to kill, they usually succeed unless they are killed or arrested first.  Plenty of people were killed before guns were invented.
eng_test_2905	I say release the guy and Kirk Mitchell (story's author) should give him free room and board while he gets his feet back on the ground again.  :-)
eng_test_2906	No he did not "buy" them. This is just a scam to get bank accounts for their business. This lot of imbiclies think the rest of ZA is stupid and can't see right through their nonsense.
eng_test_2907	Such a nasty woman.
eng_test_2908	My mom is close to 90 and I am going to spend 35 hours in planes and airports to go see her, I would not expect her to make such a long journey. Why do these people? 7000 miles is a lot for a Eighty-Three-Year-Old Disabled Grandmother to make just to make some money off a reality show. Idiots.
eng_test_2909	If Trump reneges on his pledge to not sign on to the Paris accord I am done with the man. I have stuck with him through all of his troubles but this would be tantamount to stabbing all of his supporters in the back. I realize that no one cares too much about what I think but I feel sure that many are in the same position as I find myself in.

eng_test_2911	That doesn't make any sense. It was Hazelwood, first of all. and He wasn't the captain of this ship. Kind of a knucklehead comment if you ask me. Sounds like you want to drag a man's name through the mud years after a mistake was made. Why don't you go for a walk instead of saying things that are so dumb? :)
eng_test_2912	A comparison to an industry with higher paid union jobs and non union jobs would have people actually paying some of the difference to have a union job. And just as folks will defend unions for the leadership they have given in workplace conditions, they should support a segment of farms with similar protections.   I wonder how much milk would cost at the store if the raw milk was free, fob the farm gate?
eng_test_2913	Think the male park workers been hanging around the animals way too much. They should be thrown into zoo's with the felines. Feel free to harass the felines all you want. Idiots.
eng_test_2914	You must surely mean that the Liberals are starting to look more like Liberals every day.  The Ontario Liberal's for instance or the Chretien Liberals with their promises on GST and Nafta
eng_test_2915	Oh there’s plenty of blame to go around, but that old smoothie Obama just never seems to get his just due of it. But then what do you expect of the second coming of the "teflon president", he learned well from studying his idol,  the "Gipper".

Hopefully you won't be on Walkers panel.  Actually, that is exactly what the scientist are telling us TO DO, as fast as possible to prevent all sorts of calamities threatening humans now and beyond. Figure it out. We need solutions, not old school, rah, rah, oil company rhetoric or another report.  Oil will have its needs, but just can't be part of the future energy needs.
eng_test_2920	Isn't if funny how the anc members and itself will go all out to screw everyone, even their partners...... does this organization know no end to doing people in??

Anybody who does anything with the anc in business or anything else must know they are being screwed !! What a disgusting bunch!!

eng_test_2923	Hey, you can poison YOUR kids if you choose. Sucks to be them.
eng_test_2924	You're welcome to move.
eng_test_2925	And that's the real issue here. In most bureaucracies in which I worked over the years it would have been interpreted as insubordination to broadly distribute a communication running counter to management policy, although in unionized workplaces expressing opinions consistent with union policy even where such opinions ran counter to management policy was generally permitted as long the employer's resources (i.e. work email) were not used to do so. As you've noted elsewhere, workplaces don't usually operate on the basis of "free speech."
eng_test_2926	#3 This deceptively simple distinction unites our scientific approach to knowing with all other realms of knowing. Because the Data of Sense is shared data, the collaboration and confirmation through the duplication of science is possible. Because the Data of Consciousness is subjective, internal, and can only be shared second hand, all other field of endeavor, although equally human knowing, are less successful in producing a body of broadly shared and agreed and confirmed knowledge like science.  The second level of consciousness is entered when we ask What questions, Questions for Intelligence. That is, when we ask questions with a view to Understanding the Data (of sense or consciousness) that the first level has made us aware of. Most of what we are aware of when we study or explore novel issues on our own occur on this level. The thirst, the desire, the objective on the second level is Insights, flashes of understanding that generate Explanations answering What is the case?
eng_test_2927	Slap this idiot silly then put her in jail for years.

The pathetic G&M writes amongst other things, As the law now stands, many dispensary owners across the country are engaging in what appears to be an illegal activity."  Your editorial appears to be poorly thought out nonsense to protect the corporate state.
eng_test_2942	"ETFO supports the integrated model in which students with special needs are in the regular classroom."  One size does not fit all: we need a range of models and programs. Forty years ago almost every city had facilities for children and youth: training schools, detention (open and closed), residential and day programs, special education classes for high-needs students, etc. Most of these facilities have been closed for decades.  It would be wonderful if every kid could function well in the regular stream at their local school. The reality is that there are some children who, usually for a multitude of reasons, cannot or will not at that moment in time.   Meanwhile, teachers are told to keep their hands off students. Acting-out students are aware of this policy and feel empowered by it, knowing that any physical attempt to curtail violent behaviour will result in 'trouble' for the teacher via parents, CAS and Board administration. We need alternative programs that are effective.

eng_test_2945	A History Lesson? History to the left is to tear down statues they don't like, because it reminds them that America stood up to slavery and won. History? 3000 innocent Americans, died on 9/11, 2001,  and the left blames us. America and Americans have defended countries around the world, and what have we got to show for it. An attitude that it's OUR fault. And sadly that attitude not only comes from country around the world, but from many living in this country.

eng_test_2950	Of course things take time but starting the process and being committed to seeing it through is not reactionary.  The term reactionary is usually applied to the old order (conservative/stasis) "reacting" to the new order (liberal/change).  Kind of like what the democrats did to the Bernie folks.  Kind of like what the democrats are doing to the Greens and Libertarians.  As a sign-off, I'll be out of the loop for the next 20 or so days.

eng_test_2957	Indeed the Dutch used their democracy to upgrade their infrastructure significantly, but only after losing hundreds of lives in the 1953 floods. Democracies just don't have a history of proactive risk management because untrained persons don't understand low frequency risks. It is up to risk professionals and leaders to guide better decision making in democratic environments. Businesses don't have this particular issue as decision making is typically not a democracy, but have other weaknesses.

eng_test_2968	I think right now the G&M is trying to prove it's a Conservative source. Recent headlines, like this one, are quite anti-federal-Liberal but the content of the article far less so. Not sure why they're doing it since nobody except the far right ever thought this newspaper was anything other than a Conservative supporter. But it's the paper's right to go whatever way they wish. And my right to ignore the headlines.
eng_test_2969	I'm assuming the idiot is Shannyn
eng_test_2970	The Russians clearly "hacked" the elections, by doing the job the media used to do. (and still does when it comes to Republicans)  The rooskies, in fact, were so clever, they hacked the election in order to give Clinton a 2 million vote win...  Damn rooskies.
eng_test_2971	Actually, Conservatives had much more efficient ways of raking in cash.  Through the "In and Out" scheme Conservatives submitted election expense documents to Elections Canada that were false or misleading and attempted to fraudulently gain almost $1 million in refunds from taxpayers. Eventually the Conservative Party pleaded guilty to these charges, agreeing to repay $230,198.00 for its role in the scheme.
eng_test_2972	It is obvious to anyone, with half a brain, that Trump is mentally unfit to hold the office of President. Period.  Full stop.  Being incompetent too just makes it worse.
eng_test_2973	Agree diver dave.  If the shooter were white it would be plastered all over the news and the fools would come out and destroy their community.  Talk about biased media, sickening.
eng_test_2974	"It seems almost everyone is falling for it."  It's the same crap, different packaging. It drives me crazy that people fall for that just because of Politics.

We know one thing all ready Trump does lie a lot and he for some reason thinks people don't see through the lies.

Dont forget that racist campaign.  I don't. Media didn't tell Trump to do that, he did that all by himself.  Although, I do blame the media for the creation and success of Trump.  I refuse to watch any of the 24 hours new any more.  We agree there, Sir! I'm officially no fool!  I also blame social media and the spreading of fake news.

Cutting off all trade with China would have far reaching effects but targeted sanctions against China, it's political and business leaders and state owned enterprises, similar to what has been done to Russia would be a step in the right direction.  NK is little more than a province of China. They wouldn't have fuel for their missles without China providing it to them.

eng_test_3016	Once again the old and ignorant rule the moment. Not stupid, just ignorant. What, do you think men like Trump or Sessions and their ilk have any concern for the future? Its telling that Ivanka, who has a vested interest in the future, was against this move.
eng_test_3017	The truth is liberals have found the range extent of political correctness. Yes you have your over extended pundit's points which Sarah so dutifully affirms while at the blackboard (or whiteboard) writing a hundred times, but Trump is there now to seed another way. A way which is slowly being accepted with it's roots in courage being gradually respected. It was just a spell, light headed faintness if you will that democrats were rock stars. The working class base is gone, never to return. Same applies to the republican establishment.  The base has toughened up and worries not about the frivolous-Sarah.
eng_test_3018	We heard the same sort of claims about the Tamil migrants who arrived the the two vessels being economic migrants. and the vast majority have been found Convention refugees.BY A VERY LAX CANADIAN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM  universally acknowledged as LAX by all who choose Canada instead of the 190 or so countries of the UN

eng_test_3021	Lots of idiotic comments on here , especially bob doug mac ,from people who have probably never bought a home before . Or over payed  or left money on the table selling . Funny you know , I know a lot of people who have a lot of money they acquire all they're  real estate through a knowledgeable agent. If they need legal advice they go to the best lawyer . Accounting advice they go to a real accountant.  These people who think the internet has solved everything from real estate to legal and medical advise are truly laughable.  As with any profession there are good bad and crooked in all of them. A little less limited thinking and you may be able to spot the hazards.

eng_test_3037	"Canadians wanted Trudeau to stand up to Trump."  -  Trump is a sub-literate pathological liar with a severe personality disorder. He is psychologically incapable of accepting other opinions. All he's ever known is subservience.  There is no standing up to him. There is only steering clear.
eng_test_3038	What a trifling bunch of useless, time-wasting, money-wasting, high-handed, idiotic nonsense.  Can this City Council do anything useful? They have to be taken out to the woodshed to be taught what the word "democracy" means, and they counter with this? Spiteful children is what they are.

Is Donald now claiming to be in the 17th week of his Presidency in an attempt to clear Jeff's sessions with the Russian Ambassador?
eng_test_3041	Even a "tiny-minded, hypocritical idiot" knows that Trump made a pittance of his fortune this way.  He made his money in real estate.
eng_test_3042	First, I don't appreciate the name-calling.  Had you read my notes they and most others have nothing to do with who won.  Winning is about  the electoral college and I accept that.  But it is not up to us to prove your far fetched theories wrong.  It is up to you to prove them right.  We have 50 states' certifications of vote counts on our side.  What do you have?   My concern was never about who won, which you would understand if you read my comments.  It's about the use of wildly inaccurate illegal voting accusations as a pretext for restricting voting rights by eligible citizens in the future.
eng_test_3043	F***ing moron apparently.
eng_test_3044	If Ivanka were liberal Democrat doing exactly the same things under a Democrat administration yo would be cheering her as a well accomplished woman. But she is conservative ins a Republican administration so you slag her.  Women are the most poisonous towards  other women
eng_test_3045	And Trump continues his lifelong cowardice by not making this announcement himself.  What an awful human being .....
eng_test_3046	What a show. Moral of the story, don't be a jihadist and go kill westerners in other countries and expect Canada to kindly kiss your posterior.  And please, if you hate the west, stay out of Canada, because it's a western country.
eng_test_3047	Liberals always inject division. Trump NEVER mentioned race. White players who are ignorant of the Flag and anthem also acted like ungrateful fools. You are the racist bigot for mentioning racism. MAGA every day. Your corrupt hag lost the election, get over it!
eng_test_3048	Yeah, you're probably right.  Let's just wait another 50 years until we know unequivocally, 100% damned sure that we've screwed ourselves.  Then let's start to come up with a plan on what to do.  That'll probably work out well for us... I've got news for you - the physics of flight isn't fully understood yet (nor is anything else related to fluids).  But somehow we've managed to do pretty well with what we DO know about it, don't you think?  Maybe there's a lesson there.   Not every scientist "believes" in evolution.  Yet it has been going on for more than a billion years despite what some believe.   As soon as you have evidence that convinces more than half the world's scientists to believe that humans are NOT screwing the earth over, I'll believe it.  Until then I'm going with the 97%.
eng_test_3049	... I still fly my flag EVERY DAY and NIGHT (properly lit up) ... I decided love of country is more important than the MORONS who elected this IDIOT.  The longer Cheetolini takes to hire fire hire fire hire fire everyone, the longer it'll take him and his STOOGES to really get a full head of MORON STEAM towards inflicting harm on the USA and it's citizens.  You gotta find as many moral victories as you can for the next 3.5 years.  At which time we'll elect Michelle Obama, with Oprah as her running mate.  I'm calling it NOW.  I was right about Obama when he spoke at the DNC for the 1st time ... I knew he'd be President someday.  If Trump is suitable to elect, Michelle definitely is and would do a great job ...

eng_test_3056	"SAIF has been targeted before. In 1982, Gov. Vic Atiyeh and the state Legislature closed a budget shortfall in part with $81 million taken from SAIF. The courts eventually ordered that the money be repaid, with interest."  You would like to think that any attorneys advising this 'Task Force' could do at least the minimal research required to discover this case.    But, the Legislative Counsel's Office has ignored the law on all other PERS 'solutions' and been slapped down three separate times just on the State and Federal Impairment of Contracts provision.   Maybe they are U of O Law School graduates that did manage to pass the bar but still are stupid?
eng_test_3057	Wow! Just wow! The scenario that Trump could fire Mueller has been talked about since Mueller was named special counsel but I never thought that there would be any inkling of a chance that Trump could be that stupid. I also felt that if Trump did fire Mueller that that would convince even Trump's most diehard supporters that Trump is corrupt and needs to be removed. But I already see Trump sycophants lining up to defend the indefensible....It's mind boggling!
eng_test_3058	No, the ACA is NOT "Romneycare writ large", nor would make it difference if it were.  There were several Republican proposed alternatives to the ACA, among them:  http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2009/nov/05/gop-health-care-reform-simple-explanation/  http://www.factcheck.org/2010/02/still-on-the-table/  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/health/policy/04health.html  and there have since been updated and revised proposals.  The final product will support five goals, and it is likely the law will be debated and actually read before it is passed.  https://abetterway.speaker.gov/_assets/pdf/ABetterWay-HealthCare-PolicyPaper.pdf  1 - Repeal Obamacare  2 - Provide more choices, lower costs, and greater flexibility  3 - Protect our nation’s most vulnerable.  4 - Spur innovation in health care.  5 - Protect and preserve Medicare.

eng_test_3060	Absolute trash. Amazing how many hollow WaPo hit pieces citing "a source" are behind these repeated hysterical liberal stampedes even after Comey testified the media were publishing garbage during the entire Trump tenure which was loosely based on some leak and completely lacked accuracy.   This is a wonderful display of confirmation bias, and these idiots actually think the president is going to be IMPEACHED. My GOD, the mass hysteria and delusion. I don't think we've seen anything like this since War of the Worlds created a panic.  MY GOD you people are so clueless. Don't you know a poor source citation when you see one? "A source"? Seriously??!!
eng_test_3061	A personal garbage bag  that claims to be the whole dump.

I read elsewhere that Trudeau knew about this issue and was going to give in to her demand lol. Not really a clinch  seemed like more of a shoe in with a minor setback that had been discussed and agreed upon.
eng_test_3064	Poppy-head! Oh no, unAmerican, corrupt, treasonous and a few more that probably wouldn't pass the civility test, but you get the point. America was never meant to follow especially not a bunch of weak kneed, mealy mouth, European socialists.

She guided a fractious board through a leadership and budget crisis.  She could do it again.  She knows more about PPS than anyone I know.  And cares more about teachers and children than anyone I know.

eng_test_3081	Hoping to hear some commentary on the Super Bowl, I listened to Blundell for the first time on Monday morning during the drive to work.  All I heard was the most puerile and offensive mockery of the tennis umpire who had been hit in the face the previous day.  After a few minutes of that I changed the channel, wondering what kind of a station would hire such an idiot.
eng_test_3082	Good point, gold plated freedom 55 for me, a "gig economy" with no benefits, no pension, nada, for you.  Parasites, all of them.
eng_test_3083	I agree with everything you say about Bannon, but would respectfully submit that you're wrong about Trump. He's anything but anyone's useful idiot. He possesses a keen political instinct that has gotten him out of every bind and allows him to land on his feet stronger than ever whenever the going gets rough. He has street smarts - you'll have to give him that, and I do so begrudgingly. Combine that with Bannon's cunning and proven ability to foment the basest emotions among the lowest wrung of the lowest common denominator, and you have a combo truly made in hell. Welcome to hell.
eng_test_3084	Your lying is criminal when you insist to destroy and attack BC/ citizens of Canada for an American-owned company that destroyed the economy in the USA (ENRON) for a a pipeline through earthquake zones for CHINA. That is Absolutely stupid, reckless and treason.

Perhaps a little "chill out" followed by some great junk food will give them a bad ass case of the giggles.  Drug problems are never funny nor is crime but everyone thinks that marijuana is going to be the end of the world.  I just don't get it.

eng_test_3098	This situation doesn't make a lot of sense.   There are factors not being taken into consideration.    There are supposedly only 20 cases in the world??   I'd question that and wonder whether this is really another condition.  The question I would ask is what genetic testing was done and how carefully were other contributing factors considered?   Or was the testing for IBD/IBS genes only, in which case a whole range of metabolic conditions haven't been taken into account?   What nutritional testing was done?   I'd personally go to the US and find the best functional medicine person out there I could if I were in this little boy's parent's shoes.  I would test for B12, the nutrient that can destroy health so easily it's not funny if there's not enough.  I'm a huge believer in the power of genetic testing and knowledge it can bring to help us all improve our health.   There's also a danger in the "siloed" knowledge that can arise.   There is already far too much of that in medicine.

eng_test_3104	So we have two homeless advocates - counting Lynn - claiming that "the community" supports these rest stops throughout the city.  That's a mighty small echo chamber.  I won't support more facilities for the legit homeless until we make some effort to oust the lifestyle homeless.
eng_test_3105	It was sanctions against Japan that motivated them to attack Pearl Harbour. Just saying. How far do you want to back North Korea into a corner? Where's the tipping point, and what happens after? I hope the sanctions prove to be as useless and ineffective as they've always been. Trump is not going about this properly. I'm not big on appeasement, but this could be asking for trouble, and I'm sure there has to be a better middle ground and a more viable long-term solution.

eng_test_3109	Trump and Clinton COMBINED got less than 10% of eligible voters' votes in the primaries.  The sad fact is neither of these candidates were optimal and popular and talked about the fundamental changes needed to help heal the divide, the environment and working class.  They were the only two candidates left standing, that's all.  I've been outspoken against the Electoral College for decades.  It is another way to control elections.  I am hoping trump sprouts wings, compassion, intelligence and wisdom in the next couple of weeks; but I have much doubt. We have plutocratic oligarchy running our government and it has for many decades. Bernie Sanders would have been a good choice but the rich and powerful would not let him in.

eng_test_3140	Being a Syrian I can testify that this report is based on baseless information only to torpedo the peace efforts that is about to take place and to stop Trump from coming closer to Russia. From the very beginning, the war in Syria was never a war for democracy or freedom. It was/is a war by proxy where terrorists are used under fake names and stories. The goal is to induce regime change and achieve political outcome that serves the West and Israel. All Western governments directly or indirectly are involved in this crime against Syria. The UN and other international organizations are mostly biased to what the West is saying. The so called Syrian rebels never wanted to challenge Assad in a fair and just election. That what their masters instructed them because they know from intelligence reports that Assad will win due to his  support by most Syrians. The fact that he endured all this pressure and outcries, is self evident that he is genuinely supported.

eng_test_3153	Quantifying what will "reduce carbon emission enough to significantly reduce the rise in atmospheric CO2."  has not happened yet.  "We must reduce' is as close to quantification as we have seen.    What a billion pound reduction (to pick a number at random) would do and in what time frame is beyond the current science.

eng_test_3163	Hywnsytl, a part of me agrees with you. You make sense. But the other part says Coach Rolo understands people and motivation. His message is clear to all the players -- "Work hard and good things follow." If he didn't reward work ethic, then a different message is clear -- "Doesn't matter how hard you work. Only the talented will be rewarded." This message is fine for the NFL where money talks. But this is college ball, and the players are students first. The coach's job is to make them believe they can grow if they work hard -- and if they work hard enough, they can win.  We've seen, time and again, coaches taking average players and motivating them to play beyond their individual capacity.  That's the definition of a great coach, and we're lucky to have had our share of really great ones -- in my time: Tomey, Wags, and June.  And now we have Rolo, and all the signs say he is destined for greatness, too.

The FBI Director is  is responsible to the attorney general, not exactly a "nobody".  Lynch obviously was attempting to influence the narrative on Clinton. Nice try though, but don't let all of that spinning make you dizzy.
eng_test_3177	A number of people have mentioned that the group of hikers should have been making noise, which raises a question: Were the guides and hikers being quiet on purpose so they had a better chance of seeing bears and other wildlife? All of us face this dilemma when hiking. If you shout and yell and sing as you're hiking, you reduce the risk of bumping into a bear, but you're going to scare off other wildlife as well. Plus, all the racket kind of defeats the whole purpose of going for a walk in the woods. The thing is, there are way more vessels and eco-companies taking people for walks in the Alaskan woods and mountains than there were a decade ago. People visiting Alaska want to see wildlife. Which means a lot of eco-companies and their guides are in a difficult position.
eng_test_3178	Good attempt at trying to characterize the Trump Clusterfuge as intentional.  I mean, the whole "move fast " thing was, but the idea that no one would notice the cupidity and subterfuge going on, nope. I guess Trump thinks all Americans are as stupid as his followers. Bad mistake.

The land it passes through was given to the Natives in an 1851 treaty between the tribes and the US government, signed at a meeting near the Missouri River at an historical site that also will be obliterated.  Why should the Native corporation have to pay anything for this pipeline that will give them nothing in return, at best? You have a very strange notion of propriety, I have to say.

Even with about 87,000 troops he could not defeat about 38,000 Rebels: excellent soldiers under the brilliant command of Generals Lee, Jackson, Longstreet, and Stuart.  The Yanks finally held the field only because General Lee was so outnumbered that he had to consolidate his forces or the Yanks, which outnumbered him by more than 2:1, would have been able (even under the dope McClellan) to surround elements of the Army of Northern Virginia.  Lincoln used the battle to free slaves in areas controlled by the Rebels and keep slavery (and Fugitive Slave Laws) in the Border States and areas of the South controlled by the Yanks.

We don't bother to paint the wood shed and there are a collection of old windows stored behind it that hubby is turning into a greenhouse this summer. Hardly the definition of junk yard, but that's what the new neighbors view it as.  Another neighbor has a project car and totaled car that he's cannibalizing for parts in his driveway. After three years he drove the project car away this weekend to have it painted. Will the wreck go away soon? He might need parts off it in the future, so is it any of my business?  Then there is the guy by my brother's place with a dozen old wrecks unmoved for decades. Seeking to fix him, I might end up painting a shed. BCWYWF

eng_test_3262	This pair of dirty neofeudalist shills have never been right about anything.  I had hoped the Globe had turfed them.
eng_test_3263	And if any other necessity of life was subject to even a 10% annual inflation rate, let alone 30%, it would be deemed a national crisis. The question is why isn't it seen that way for shelter?
eng_test_3264	I doubt very much that you "chose" to be heterosexual. I know that gays do not say, "I think I will be homosexual. It must be fun to be a member of a despised and persecuted minority."  And you are still hung up on "gay sex is icky".
eng_test_3265	You are a snit stained retard..
eng_test_3266	But you will support Obama and the Liberals who want to raise your tax's even more Fool!  Hope someone beats some sense into your head!
eng_test_3267	Neither is a baker...there are plenty of bakers out there who'd be happy to bake you a phallic wedding cake, these types of things are only to attack Christians for their convictions. Besides if you're gay why would you want to give your $ to people who disagree with your way of living? Find a friendly baker...
eng_test_3268	LOL..if violating the oath of office was an impeachable offense....obama would have been impeached multiple times!  If violating the rule of law AND the Constitution was an impeachable offense, obama would have been impeached multiple times!  Yet the pathological lying sociopath was elected not once, but twice.   I'm thinking, Mr. Quirk, you're going to hate the next eight years!!!!  LOL
eng_test_3269	Trudeau is a complete idiot just like his old man.
eng_test_3270	Hard work yields results! Good job Ms. Aikins!
eng_test_3271	It is stuff like this that makes me think Iam living in bizarro world, why do we consistently have these stupid exspensive and yet worthless projects? Why in a time of not tight budgets but crisis can we simply not so no thanks and kill these?
eng_test_3272	Go jogging and eat less. Invest in your health.
eng_test_3273	Sen. John McCain got this ball rolling so he's in it up to his eyeballs,they all new it was fake but they ran with it anyway.
eng_test_3274	He is not saying that some votes are not counted. He is saying that they do not count toward electing someone. There are people who have voted in elections for 50 years, and never cast a ballot for someone who became a representative.  All ballots are counted. Many do not count toward representation.
eng_test_3275	Personally, I am more worried about the violent idiots I see on television actually setting cars and buildings on fire in Portland or Seattle as their 'Free Speech" than the rednecks with their flags.  When I see Confederate  Flag people blocking East 11th Street, slashing tires, using obscene language to support their hate and attempting to get riots started, then I may become more concerned about that particular group of idiots.  Until then, the violent anti-Trumps are at the top of my list of troublemakers for what they are actually doing and getting arrested for throughout the entire country, not because of their supposed 'beliefs'.
eng_test_3276	A pigmentary bigot.  A racist bigot.  A theological bigot.
eng_test_3277	Bigot, the british invaded Canada, and france did nothing to help.  and you are a divisive arrogant bigoted jerk who is breaking up the country.  The battle isnt over.  The 258 year old struggle will end in a Canadian Republic.  Vive la république!!!
eng_test_3278	You don't need the hyperbole. Discretely being armed to answer the door, or do anything else in life, isn't paranoia. If you need the weapon you have it, if you don't the other person never knows it's there.
eng_test_3279	That's contradicted by the facts. First of all, Democrats have acknowledged the past and the party evolved to the anti-racist side, which prompted southern racists who used to constitute the Solid South for the party to migrate to the GOP, where the South now pretty much votes solidly for Republicans due to the GOP's adoption of the racist polices the Democrats used to push. If there are any remaining racists in the Democratic Party, the members will marginalize and push them out.  The Democratic Party of the 1800s, though, was the conservative party. They were not "leftist" at all.  Entitlements are not "slavery." That's just a silly remark, pre-packaged propaganda to demonize people who need help. Look at Ben Carson -- on public assistance and loans and public housing all his life until he made it on his own, and now he demonizes welfare. Bunch of hypocrites.
eng_test_3280	Damn ! this is front page G&M ? spending all that oil money wisely I see.  Why are the models on their website not wearing the head scarf ? Don't they get in trouble for doing that   Decent job on Dragons' Den, Although I don't think declining the dragons offer was the wisest of moves.
eng_test_3281	at least we know where these Liberal brainwashed deadbeats are located. They don't even know why there are revolting. Trump never took anything away from them. HE JUST GOT INTO OFFICE DUMMIES!
eng_test_3282	Instead of just constantly complaining about legal marijuana like some impotent idiot, why don't you put your money where your mouth is and move to a state that still prohibits its use? Oh right, because you'd rather complain than actually get off your ass and do anything.
eng_test_3283	“I do think we owe President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee the hearing and the vote that Merrick Garland never received,” said Sen. Chris Coons D-Del."  No, they don't.  There is too much at stake; it's a generational issue and the SCOTUS appointment shouldn't be made by Steve Bannon.
eng_test_3284	Obviously many detractors do not know a well run b and b operation.  No cars parked all over the street.  Guests park on property.  No noise or disruptive behavior.  The people staying there are not looking for trouble and the hosts are on property.  Any trouble and the guests will end up staying at a hotel.
eng_test_3285	... he has NEVER worked a day in his life, and failed with all his business ventures, over and over again.  Republicans are straight up bat sh** cra cra for electing this guy, when will they stop laughing at his antics and realize he is harming the USA.  The Republicans that voted for this moron need to pull the thumb on their voting records, step up to the plate, admit they were wrong.  Really shameful Republicans would elect such a moron.
eng_test_3286	"Glenn Oshiro wasn't making this up on his own, he was satirizing the president-elect's choice of locker room banter. If Glenn Oshiro's post makes you uneasy, please address complaints to the president-elect..."

eng_test_3294	So funny, you name one here and rest your case. Their are 44 landlocked nations on Earth. Switzerland and Austria are exceptions not rules. Alberta would be more like Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Ethiopia, Bolivia, or Afghanistan that it would be like Switzerland or Austria. Alberta is a large province with a small population of only 4 million. It would be a joke and you all should know it.
eng_test_3295	You do realize you're on the losing side, right? We American service members love to kill Nazis... geez, my Grandpa personally killed hundreds of them in WW2.
eng_test_3296	Gee, then I guess what I saw with my own eyes - including Trump's reaction to it - was wrong.  Further, the good old Polish Presudent has his own problems with "media liars" who promulgate fake news about him. It's gotten to where politicians just cannot lie with impunity and get away with it anymore.   Note:  All any person who feels they've been lied about has to do is prove the lie with actual evidence and facts.  So far, Trump - infamous proven  pathological liar - and his whining Polish buddy haven't been able to meet that mediocre standard.
eng_test_3297	That's what happened when all the 'politically correct' people elected a muslim, who in himself, hated OUR country.  Notice most of the protesters are black.  If you don't like this country, move to North Korea....you should have one hell of a life there.
eng_test_3298	Just another crooked Trudeau! What a disappointment. If I ever vote Liberal again please poke me in the eye with a sharp stick!
eng_test_3299	The resurrection of the CRC has been going on for over a year. While some of the politicians and the Columbian have loudly proclaimed "the CRC is dead"; nothing could be further from the truth. And this story highlights that reality.  Read this piece that lays out the events of the past 13 months. It also has supporting documents and video statements.  http://johnley.us/resurrecting-the-crc/
eng_test_3300	Let's not make this nurse a martyr. The cop was stupid, did a dumb thing and will probably be suspended. But she didn't go to jail and was released after 20 minutes in a police car. This is not a momentous event in civil rights. The nurse is obviously playing it up to get her 15 minutes of fame.

eng_test_3303	Still ignorant Qbcoach15 must be all those Traumatic Brain Injuries.  Muslim Culture (do not prove your ignorance by saying "Religion") is a Culture of War.    Mohammad unified the Waring Tribes that were killing themselves, into Large Armies, his Armies were conquering "the Known World".  His large Armies had a Severe Logistics Problem, Mohammad then wrote the Holy Koran making it Law for All Nations to provide Food, Clothing, Support, Money to the Armies, and that All Must Join the Jihad without any excuses.  109 Suras of the 114 Suras of the Holy Koran are the Declared War Against Christians, Jews, Unbelievers.  The 5 Suras state that Peace will be achieved when all Christians, Jews, Unbelievers are Subjugated to Islam.  The Holy Celebration of Ramadan is the Muslim Celebration of the Defeats and Massacres of the Christians, Jews, Unbelievers.  Ramadan Fasting represents the Muslims getting up before dawn eating and drinking then going into Combat without food and water.  continued
eng_test_3304	Is wittle woy still hurt in his butt?
eng_test_3305	Or LianingonRob...we could avoid the emotional hyperbole about suicide and acknowledge that there are a disproportionate number of students at university today who simply have no reason being there. that is aside from those who are truly struggling such as the commenter who noted that she had been sexually assaulted and suffered a concussion. At work that would be reason for a stint of short-term disability. Accommodation? No employer in his/her right mind would want the liability of a concussed employee at work - not to even mention the sexual abuse aspect. But university? Sure, come on in. We'll accommodate. At the risk of sounding like an oldie, in my day that would be reason for a missed term or even a missed year depending upon the severity. A therapy dog just wouldn't cut the mustard.
eng_test_3306	Call me names; hostile, angry, I have the right to take offense when I'm being mugged.
eng_test_3307	You truly are the most ignorant putz imaginable.
eng_test_3308	I think the way people squirm when they hear the "four letter word" and the way they are still squirming over a raised middle finger is sad. Yes I appreciate the "cultural differences" and all that but feel it's time to grow up and realize, to acknowledge, how both are used in context. In our social discourse, our entertainment, in a myriad of settings, so much so as to suggest that it is not the "big deal" that it may have been in days gone by, and certainly does not warrant the attention it is still getting here today.   Oh and, by the way, I think Chelsea did us all a favor by reflecting our discontent, and doing it in such a way as to make the vision stick, to rub our noses in it. Yes the DNC screwed Bernie from the get go. Yes we are now stuck with a candidate that is practically undigestible to many of us, and yes the party needs to clean up its act if it doesn't want to be torn apart as the Republicans are being now. Thank you Chelsea, again, for your service to us all.
eng_test_3309	The taxing of passive income is the biggest problem.  This will massively hurt small business and prevent the development of new companies, ultimately hurting the economy.    The passive income is how professionals save for their retirement as most do not have a taxpayer subsidized pension plan like the civil service.

eng_test_3325	If climate and weather go hand in hand, when it is zero and snowing, the climate is arctic? When it is a hundred degrees and dry, the climate is tropical desert? Odd and amusing things come from the minds of the ignorant.
eng_test_3326	Chuck must be another opinion writer who has a connection at the Globe that can publish anything with a byline that tries to savage Trump. This isn't clever, funny, smart, insightful or even moderately badly written.
eng_test_3327	To steal a quote from our incompetent president's own tweet; Trump "has become a great threat and embarrassment" to America. Let's get him out of the White House and Make America Great Again!

eng_test_3330	How old were you when you descended into crankish contrarianism Mark?  If your arguments were persuasive, they wouldn't need to be layered with intolerance of any point of view that doesn't align with your own..  Climate change is not the issue that defines our times.  It is what political charlatans have turned it into that is the issue.  There's not a shred of credible evidence supporting the theory that tax grabs and opaque cap-and-trade schemes have the slightest impact on consumption of carbon based fuels, for which demand is notoriously inelastic.  Europeans pay more than twice our automobile fuel prices, but still produce some of the most ridiculously over-powered, gas-guzzling automobiles on the planet.  How could that be?  Kathleen Wynne has kneecapped Ontario's economy with out-of-control spending and ludicrously inept attempts to game the energy market.  Only a complete fool couldn't see that now.

eng_test_3335	As a man I feel the need to address this.  Go away little boy. You are not funny or witty and mansplaining to women how they should act is stupid at best and misoganistic at best.  Why don't you tell the father's to keep their junk soft? Why is it only the women's job, oh wait, that is right because men are just sex crazed machines right?   It takes two people to stop a pregnancy and acting like a big tough man telling women to keep their legs closed is so old school I think Instagram has a filter for it.

eng_test_3340	I have no respect for the 45th POTUS, but you backed a candidate who's party has a flawed democratic process to pick it's candidate. It's clear to me that HC lost the election more than Trump won it. Super Delegates anyone?

eng_test_3346	For those who can get beyond the childish arguments about personalities, and want to debate policy, a main issue seems to be challenges to the traditional public schools models.  See the enlightening history of what happened in New Orleans after Hurricance Katrina for a unique case study.  The summary: the state of LA took over what was a largely entrenched and failing local school district, and replaced traditional public schools and teachers with mostly charter schools free to hire staff of their choosing.  Twelve years later, most kids are doing much better.

eng_test_3354	Wow and people wonder why many black people just wont "let things go." If i were one of them i'd dislike me too. But it's people like you who are a disgrace using God's name to try and justify your sophomoric thought process. And pretty sure God doesn't give a shit about politics as much as he does about people created in his image treating each other like garbage, and saying ridiculous things like you did.
eng_test_3355	As someone who has been a part of the Oregon Country Fair for over 25 years, our track record for "problems" is actually exemplary. Gather that many people in one spot, anywhere, and there will be those who just can't act appropriately. OCF is one of the most creative gatherings in the United States, with amazing crafts, over the top music, and a peaceful vibe that just won't quit. Try a crowd of rowdy drunks at a Duck football game if you want to see inappropriate behavior at its finest.

eng_test_3370	Perhaps I should have used the word "Speculation" rather than "Opinion".  I do understand what I read and the vast majority of these thought pieces are speculation.  You can have an opinion on what has happened or transpired, but few are skillful enough to predict events or consequences in the future.  Take foreign trade for instance.  Can anyone predict that bi-lateral trade deals not yet made will be better or worse than multi-lateral trade deals that were never consummated in the first  place, such as TPP?  The examples of speculative "thought" pieces are too numerous to mention, including how some individual will perform his or her duties in the future.  Journalistic integrity seems to be at an all time low.  If you want to see contrasting examples, just read the Investors Business Daily political section and compare it with the New York Times and Washington Post.

eng_test_3376	AT, read the quote. Just because he is good at one thing doesn't mean he is good at anything else. Here are a few of this nut job's quotes: 1. "Gayness must be a choice, because prisoners who get raped come out gay." 2. "Obamacare is worse than slavery" 3. "The Big Bang was a fairy tale and the notion of evolution was encouraged by the devil"  4. "Nope, I don't see any global warming"  5. "Nope, I don't see any racism" 6. "Planned Parenthood is a plot to kill black babies" (how does he reconcile number 5 and 6? Is there, or isn't there racism?) He may be an idiot savant but he is certainly an idiot.
eng_test_3377	LOL! How disappointed you are going to be. And, actually, we're all hoping Mexifornia eventually slides below the waves of the Pacific making Nevada and Arizona coastal states. 😎
eng_test_3378	Why should the local Cities like Toronto, Markham, Aurora etc do anything?  Based on market value assessment they are raking in more money.  My property tax in Markham will be up 50% in this cycle.  I asked my local Councelor  if they would be reducing the mill rate but no.  I hate to think what the next cycle will bring after the recent spike brought on by speculators with irrational exuberance.   I wish the media would stop calling these folks investors, call a spade a spade, they are speculators.
eng_test_3379	L2g not sure what you are implying....that all Veteran's are severely mentally or physically disabled? The suggestion about the "undocumented worker model" was in response to the comment describing employed yet unhoused workers couch surfing and no access to apartment life. The "model" simply points out how even those that come illegally are able to find housing. The question is...why does the culture of homelessness in the US not promote and encourage this model for independence. The culture here in the states is a mix of work, sign flying, panhandling directly asking others for "spange", handouts of food and clothing, camping near where resources are available. The mini co-op model works but not heavily practiced by the homeless here in the US.

Because you know what happened there when the people got their pitchforks and pens out after the Senate dumped Marjorie Bronster as AG.   My guess - if there is a tsunami of opinion on this, it's still being measured in inches and not feet.
eng_test_3383	Nothing except, like most people involved in a campaign, they were interested in oppo research.  This is NOT treason.  It is no big deal at all.  Mostly, it proves that liberals needs to get over the fact that Hillary lost fair and square.
eng_test_3384	stupid no,  very fast with mistakes like the green card issue yes.  the same reasons obama did it , yes
eng_test_3385	It is a hypothetical question, but I will indulge your idiocy. Of they passed such a law me and my conservative friends would gather all of our weapons and violently over throwing the government. We would create a new government which would allow me to lock you into a cell for asking dumb hypothetical questions. Then I would install our Constitution back into place and let the politicians re-ruin America.  I am not afraid of your really dumb and loaded question, I just do not take it seriously. Why would I ? If you want to believe I have a closed mind because I will not entertain a hypothetical, loaded and really dumb question super!   Believe what you want, this is America, not Stupidistan or where ever political thought is a protected class.  Have a great night, go Broncos!
eng_test_3386	Hey God, great to see you are still worth less than nothing here, trolling, fishing for that angry reaction! In terms of irritation, you are less than a pimple on my butt. HTH :>)~
eng_test_3387	Bet they don't win another game this season. Despite how much is natives and others love the broncs. They just ain't ready. They never have a solid team to gel with cuz the constant switching. They're done folks. Done.
eng_test_3388	I am saying they are a bunch of hypocrites, who are the solid losers in this election on all three fronts. This is desperation rearing its ugly head yet once again.    They are not the majority but they want to think they are. Wrong!  What a pity to watch them have their little pity party.
eng_test_3389	No RTH the fact is that she needs to lay off the biscuits and gravy. Not so bad that she's unattractive but being under pressure trying to defend the idiot makes her more unappealing.

eng_test_3392	The legislation for the referendum was flawed. It should have specified that, if Leave won, there would be no need for further parliamentary action, and the government was directly authorized to perform the necessary actions to leave. But since no such provision was included, the SC decided that parliament should be involved.
eng_test_3393	Good information. I will definitely take a look at my sunscreen !
eng_test_3394	They are corrupted. They will act in the same manner, corrupted.
eng_test_3395	Wow! I think electing a female leader in these somewhat United Staes is a bigger deal than I thought, based on these posts and the ignorance some demonstrate... What Ailes did was harassment, disgusting and represents a view of women that is at best really sick and sad, and at worst illegal. And the bosses at Fox Knew! That's the worst of the worst...they didn't back up their own revelations with actions..fire his ass, no golden parachute! No his world view was too valuable and made a few tons of money...and money is the operative reason this all happened. Make an example, regardless of party, that we are all better than that.
eng_test_3396	The right to Self-Defense is an INALIENABLE natural right. It is not subject to the whims of the tyrannical majority. Just as the right to speak and move freely. The tyrannical majority CANNOT do away with the necessities of LIFE. All it can do is provide punishments for ABUSE of those natural rights. It cannot remove them. For that would defeat the whole purpose for which our Constitution was instituted to begin with.  The founders did NOT create a suicide pact.
eng_test_3397	Oregion?
eng_test_3398	Sure, I remember him. But even he wasn't stupid enough to touch the PFD.
eng_test_3399	On a related (sort-of) issue, I was horrified to hear of the looting taking place at abandoned homes. There is only one remedy for this.  Shoot looters on sight.
eng_test_3400	There you go again little troll, itsme.  People like you are corrupt.
eng_test_3401	They built themselves a Taj Mahal. I saw that going up and couldn't figure out why we need a facility like that. And then, to top it off, we GIVE them out blood and they SELL it back to us. Now that a scam if I ever heard of one. I'd like to be able to donate and give a credit to someone, but they told me it don't work that way. It's about the money.
eng_test_3402	I hate illinois nazis.

eng_test_3405	Trump openly stated he wanted to stop and frisk and take firearms away from people the police decided should not have them(minorities as that is who stop and frisk targets).  Explain when or where Hillary has spoken about "taking anyones guns". Looks like a Democrat is getting ready to get into office and the NRA has fired up the flyer making press again.  The NRA supporting the right to own a gun, but scaring you into buying one, by claiming the next politician is going to take away the ones you do have. Seriously, this line has been around for decades and it still has not happened.  How many times does the boy have to cry wolf before you stop believing this crap?
eng_test_3406	If you look closely, Trump is already going grey in an orangey kind of way.
eng_test_3407	Anyone who does any technical work for me at all must be licensed, insured, and bonded so that I know they've met at least the minimum technical performance requirements for the position.  I also need to know that such job performers know, understand, and are able to meet minimum quality requirements.  I don't have the time or money to "experiment" with every Tom, Dick, or Harry that comes along.  Fortune tellers.....not so much.  Only idiots use fortune tellers, anyway.
eng_test_3408	Did you turn it off and back on??
eng_test_3409	Jims comment is ridiculous. There are Muslims through out the world, and the religion includes all skin colors.
eng_test_3410	Bullsh**. The other parties have been shut out by the Ds and Rs, and you know it. Sounds like you're beating the brush for a certain candidate and are not from here. Your boy isn't going to be about The People either. If he can get away with it, he'll be bad if not worse than Cheney with Halliburton.
eng_test_3411	I wonder if living on an island makes people stupid and liberal.  Look at Greece and Puerto Rico. Both islands and both bankrupt and we're close behind.

eng_test_3413	You are just mad because he didn't grab your p*****!
eng_test_3414	It astonishing how after thousands of years, teaching the Law of God has suddenly become immoral and religious malpractice! Unbelievable!
eng_test_3415	Kimmel, just shut up!  We don't care what you have to say or even watch your "not funny" show any longer!
eng_test_3416	I bought PZA at $15 on the recommendation of my investment advisor. Just a relatively small position, as I still don't quite understand the business of buying a share of the royalties, rather than a share of the actual restaurant business.   But I can't argue with the results. Up almost 20% on unrealized capital gain, plus  5% dividend.  I was in a hurry yesterday and stopped in for a slice for lunch, and lots of other people were there too.  Not great pizza, but filled a gap. As long as there are people wanting a quick slice, and more people looking to open franchises, I suppose it works. Take the money and run.
eng_test_3417	Interesting timing though.   It seems to dovetail with other machinations in the housing market.   The sociopaths and psychopaths are having lots of fun being the major *&&holes they are.   So overinvested in everything that harms others, these fools are.

eng_test_3421	This is suck bullshit.  Who picks the fruits and vegetables that we buy everyday at the grocery store?  Do these generally transient illegal immigrants not contribute?  They earn minimum wage at best, receive no health care.  Why are these people the enemy and not corporate America that doesn't pay it's share of taxes, lobbies to minimize competition and is never held accountable for their actions.  It's always easy to point the finger at those that can't defend themselves.
eng_test_3422	@CDNBB Partly agree, partly disagree.  Indeed, AC are targeting Americans in tier 2 cities like Cincinnati, Nashville, Hartford, etc., that don't necessarily have direct access to Europe/Asia destinations that Toronto/Vancouver/Montreal do. In particular at Toronto AC have put in a lot of effort to get to a pretty near seamless connection for US-originating pax going onwards. As for Americans flying into Canada straight, more and more choosing AC because of the service and choice of destinations.

eng_test_3424	Even if the cockpits are the same or similar, a pilot must still get checked out and certified in each plane. Airbus already has a joint venture called ATR which is vastly different planes, so no , not all Airbus planes are the same. As for your sales story at the end, it would be the Airbus sales selling both, and since Airbus has no planes the size of the C-Series, it would be based on what the Airline wanted and feels the could fill, that the choice would be made.
eng_test_3425	wow thats the stupid post of the day, see lefty the media was shilling for clinton pal, heck the emails exposed it clearly! ,, as for the russians, get some help for your fantasy
eng_test_3426	AK: You are misinformed about the PFD.  Your opinion is tainted by your personal expierence.  If if think my opinions are socialist you need to review socialism and it's definition. Your entitlement mindset is exactly what has us where we are.
eng_test_3427	who cares how stupid you are lefty, Trump is going to be president, hence the office deserves respect from us given its our largest customer
eng_test_3428	Thanks. I thought I was making up a title for a small working class grocery outlet, but as you point out, the name is taken. Malls like upscale stores as their customers spend the cash, but I wonder if a few Winco type stores might be better for foot traffic. I think a lot of people would like to buy their food and Apple products and maybe take in a movie during one trip.  Hugh

eng_test_3430	I don't know what your comment was but I liked it anyway. It had to be better than rest of the drivel that I found above and below your deleted comment. I especially like the person that values wild animals over humans. Just have a party, roast the goat, move on. It is amazing the issues that the public will drag the pitch forks and torches out for. Can humans be dumb?  Yes.  Am I perfect? By no means. Is this the kind of outcome I would wish on anybody or  any animal, no.  I like to hunt and eat meat, I also like to just observe wildlife in its habitat.  Nothing to see here folks, move along.  Hugs & Kisses

eng_test_3457	Agirl:  Actually she complimented the RG for calling a lie a lie.  Trump's remark was, of course, a demonstrated lie.  When you state an untrue fact it's not, as KellyAnn Conway so humorously called it, an "alternative fact".....it's simply a lie.  If President Trump doesn't want to be called a liar, he can solve that rather easily.....simply quit telling lies.   AT's attempt to attack Ms. Sullivan's webpage comment was an attempt to distract readers and invalidate her point....nothing more.  If you really want to help President Trump, perhaps you could "tweet" him and suggest he'd be far more effective if he'd quit telling lies.  ....just a suggestion.....my regards, Gary Crum

You pose the same questions over and over again. The reality is, the answers to your questions don't really matter to you or otherwise YOU would make an effort to understand this subject instead of asking for handouts.  My sense is that the only reason you want someone to hand you answers is so you can disagree with them and the facts never matter (to you.)

eng_test_3478	What a stupid article. It asserts that "Mr. Trump is bad" and yet makes no case for that at all.  One just has to look at Trump's fundamental anti-war leaning to refute the notion of 'bad' (unless one believes that war is good). As far as mad goes, Trump might be blunt and unconventional but the real madness is the mass hysteria by the Trump haters. Those people have truly lost their minds.

eng_test_3486	Cutting wages? A freeze until wages drop near  national averages would be painless and result in ZERO worker exodus.  Moving from Alberta to BC or Toronto , at equivalent pay, is essentially at least a 25% wage cut in fact. IF that is you even can find the equivalent cushy public sector job, which is highly unlikely.

eng_test_3491	What a silly, silly article. Almost as silly as The Handmaid's Tale. And to mention Trump in the context of Atwood's novel is an attempt to lower our collective IQ. I am guilty of wasting a fraction of my existence by actually reading that novel, I must admit. A time, though insignificant, I will never get back. As a kid,  behind the Iron Curtain, I read a very prohibited copy of 1984- a story that had a profound meaning to those of us trapped in the middle of the experiment which Orwell described so skillfully, but to find anything meaningful in the 21st century North America that would relate to the Atwood's story borders on paranoia.

Put tRump in front of a Howdy Doody and Howdy will inform tRump, "I'm the smart and you should met with the PDB as all other presidents have." tRump's refusal to participate in the PDB is a clear shot across the nation's bow that he has a fear of being questioned by highly intellectual people. He knows he isn't the sexual intellectual he thinks he is. Heh, heh, heh.

eng_test_3544	Cretin:  "a stupid person (used as a general term of abuse)."  So a bunch of "cretinous minions" (your words) are the ones who "scheduled 6 simultaneous hearings on cabinet nominees and triple-booked those hearings with Trump's first press conference in months and an ACA budget vote, effectively preventing any concentrated coverage or protest."  And those same "cretinous minions" also used the  "the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act" to thwart the wise, knowledgeable and astute Democrats regarding the ACA.  And Trump is going to take Federal money to build his Wall and THEN have Mexico pay for it.  Not bad for a bunch of how did you say it:  "cretinous minions"!

eng_test_3570	Here's the rub Mr. Scott: You state that it "stinks" when some find ways to subvert American Law. I think that is a gross understatement and what they are doing is not simply "subverting American law" but rather using their religious and political power as a majority religion to directly inspire acts of terrorism as the MEANS by which they achieve their political goals.  Dean Lewis Dear was directly inspired by the rhetoric of evangelical and other "Christians" or is it Christians (I don't know and don't care) to attack the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado in 2015.  You claim that a small minority of people hate women which, if by this you mean people who consciously hate women, could be correct. My assertion is different. I assert that the Christian religion has stigmatized women as being inherently "sinful" and influences society in general to view women as persons requiring sadistic punishments.  They want American women to pay for Eve's sin. We reject this and them.

You got your income sprinklers (upper middle-class professionals who can afford a sharp accountant), your genuine entrepreneurs (who understand that if you simply locate your intellectual property in a tax haven subsidiary, you can pretty much avoid taxes completely) and your corporations (statutory corporate tax rate in Canada is around 26% but many TSX companies pay less than 10%).

Why should I have to be a responsible and trained citizen when ignorant individuals can exercise their RIGHT of free speech to lie and spout off inaccurate information to support their political viewpoint?  Why should I be subject to jail if I fail to utilize a surname on one document or make a mistake writing a serial number? Why would we allow someone to get several DUI's when simply waving a firearm (loaded or not) would subject an individual to losing their constitutional rights and jail time.  Cars are given to kids with special exemptions because they are underage but we can't provide even safety training for a firearm.  My dear citizen, you remain willingly ignorant.

A HDPE-flexpipe shipping unprocessed gas can be defined as a ASTM/API gas-gathering pipe if we use it to transfer the raw-condensate to Nenana for re-injection, like CINGSA.

If you silence speech which is 'hateful' you are against free speech. We need to protect speech which is 'nasty' not speech which is 'nice'.   As to your belief in the need for safety and protection as Franklin famously observed, "those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety." Who are you to be so patronising and condescending that you feel it right that people not be allowed to listen to someone you personally disagree with?   "If we could rely on the citizenry to be thoughtful judges of the quality and truth of the thoughts, Milo would not be dangerous. But, he is." And there we have the illiberal authoritarian revealed in all their glory. Ultimately you despise the masses and believe they need to be 'protected' or shepherded in certain directions for their own good.   You are a humbug.

eng_test_3611	Agreed, & yet I also agree with Edmund Burke, who said "All that is necessary for evil men to triumph is for good men to do nothing." Drone killing is evil, since it is execution without trial, & it is cowardly, since it is often done from a comfortable chair, thousands of miles away from the murder scene. Drones kill lots of innocent bystanders too, & it is common for their operators to "double-tap" a strike. They fire a missile which kills their subject & anyone in his vicinity, even in the house next door, but also wounds lots of innocent bystanders. When the locals come running to see if they can help any survivors, the demonic drone operators fire again, killing rescuers & good samaritans. If that isn't evil to you then you are devoid of conscience. I also agree with Gandhi, who said "You may believe what you are doing is inconsequential, but it is exceedingly important that you do it." When our lives are over, do you believe we're held accountable for them? Do what you can.

eng_test_3617	That's the point:  there were no limitations. This change rolls back an administrative order - not the law that requires drillers to adhere to NEPA. The compliance with the laws is still the same. There is still a public comment period and both the government agencies AND the proponent (in this case drillers) have to incorporate and address the comments.
eng_test_3618	And as voters, the mess of 'stupid politicians' is upon our hands as we typically just toe the party line in our voting instead of doing our homework and then voting for a representative who cares about the issues more than just keeping a job by doing the party's bidding, now too heavily funded and dictated by deep pocketed special interests.

eng_test_3622	It is the job of the President to bring the country together. Obama was blamed as the most divisive president ever.  To quote Trump,  "I've been saying for a long period of time that he's the most divisive president maybe that we've ever had and he had an opportunity to bring the country together...the fact is, he's been the most divisive president I think we've ever had.   Trump's challenge will be to live up to his promise that "I would be a total unity president." I look forward to that: a "total" unity president.  The greatest. So great. It's gonna be great.
eng_test_3623	I agree. Just like Rob Ford's deplorables there is a fixed percentage who will support him no matter what. There has to be enough erosion to make repub congresspeople believe their seats are in trouble and so far hasn't happened. But there is still a drip drip drip happening I bet.
eng_test_3624	There has always been a nationalist strain in Quebec political society, one that favours sovereignty, and it's not going to go away any time soon. Quebecers pretty well take this in their stride while the English language media express amazement when it pops up again, and again.  It's not the majority voice but it is significant and many non-sovereigntists feel a measure of sympathy for it whether they actually embrace it or not. Thinking it is dead and buried only to have it once more "walk among us" can be dispiriting.  It will come back at some point and it's best to be prepared.
eng_test_3625	I've accepted the fact that the uneducated people in our country elected Donald Trump, based on a lack of knowledge about what he represents. The part I'm having trouble with is that Trump is completely unfit to lead our country. There's a reason so many people are calling for an evaluation of his mental health. If there's anyone who can't see that, then the incompetence has spread even further than Trump.

eng_test_3638	So desperate the trumpsters are for everyone to believe that The Trumpster is the legitimate POTUS elect, even though it is now apparent that one of the United States' greatest adversaries was one of his biggest supporters, and helped him win the election. It's extremely pathetic that his rabid fanatics don't understand what that really means.  The Trumpster is never going to be a legitimate president; he's always going to be Russia's candidate for POTUS, a huge win for Putin, and Russia's intelligence community.  Besides all of that, it's become obvious to anyone of even modest intelligence, and a penchant for fact checking, that when The Trumpster's lips are moving there's little doubt he's lying.
eng_test_3639	You're not clear how the supply/demand, dispatchable/intermittent, peak vs. off-peak power planning works, are you? Well, no shame in that... it's complicated.  Surplus power sold into the off-peak spot market almost always trades at a deep discount, regardless of source. One of the advantages of moving to electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids is that these will form a large but flexible demand in off-peak hours, and where every 5 to 6 kWh replaces 1 liter of gasoline that would otherwise have been burned.

eng_test_3643	Perps like Tallman should be in stripes on a chain  gang.  Vote liberal judges OUT.
eng_test_3644	This was not a military op, they were not well trained or exacuted in any sence of what you think. Gang bangers thinking they can ... All that and a bag of chips. LEO's need to be police and not "think" they are military. That's why they get there ass kicked
eng_test_3645	Every day you complain that the SA is fake news yet you are a subscriber. I would never pay to read anything that I thought was fake news. Only a moron would do that....

eng_test_3648	To fund the current profligate ak.gov, along with those lavish Tier1 retirement benefits (Read: Folks sunning themselves and no longer providing any "services") it's the PFD, your paycheck, or both.     Blame big oil all you want.  Bottom line is  $7 BILLION+ unfunded state employee retirement benefits has to come from somewhere.  Wow, no medical copay for the "anointed" ones?  Go figure.

eng_test_3650	My advice to " Tweety " is, do not mess with the Chinese.  If you do, you'll regret it.  If the Chinese are still smarting over the destruction in 1860 of the Yuanmingyuan - 圆明园 - one of the most horribly devastating acts of British and French imperialism, the anger  will cause Chinese to smash you to smithereens.  And you know what, you'll will deserve it.  However this time, it will take you a hundred years to forget what they have done to you in retaliation for your stupidity.
eng_test_3651	And you should not be allowed to post stupid comments. You assumed a situation where he could walk away. Don't assume things not already in evidence.

eng_test_3652	You should have given up thoughtless writing.  We would have been spared this tripe.  Meat is delicious, meat is healthy and meat is life sustaining.

You are just another liberal hypocrite who thinks you know better than the rest of us.  You are a dinosaur who didn't notice the asteroid impact.

I wonder how long the animal suffered because of the inaccuracy of the educated stupid person just looking for a paycheck,er,uh I mean trooper." Is it too much to ask for the civil gestapo to stifle the "happy pills" before voting on the poster's comments?

eng_test_3658	I would be grateful if someone who is knowledgeable can help describe the impact on this: What if a small business owns or wants to purchase and own their building, lets say it was purchased and financed for $1.5 million. And they now pay their rent to the building in a CCPC or holding company.  Is there a reason not to do this now? Or a certain limit to the value of a building the small business could or should own?  Thanks so much in advance for any input. I'm out my league here.
eng_test_3659	What a dumb response. This was sheer posturing on the part of the NDP to score some political points. The question is why was Mr Wilson singled out in the first place. Perhaps it is the NDP who are expressing sour grapes.
eng_test_3660	WOW how hypocritical you are.  Who are you to determine what opinions that happen to differ from yours is hateful, an opinion is neither hateful or loving, it is just an opinion and we are all free to our own opinions.  Just as it is my opinion that you are a total moronic leftist that needs to get your head out of the clouds and back down to Earth and reality!
eng_test_3661	Markham-Thornhill voted Liberal even in 2011.  None of the things you cite have any traction against the government -- apart from the budget, of course, which hasn't happened yet, but the populace don't care about deficits, if that's what you're banking on.

eng_test_3683	The Swastika symbol has also come to have its own more generic meaning too. as being a symbol representing intolerance and hate.   So one might spray paint it anywhere one thought that hatred and intolerance existed.   Many on the left have used it in protests against Donald Trump, as well as many other conservatives, for example.  So you are right that it is not necessarily a Nazi.   The Nazi movement is all but dead in our country.   The handful that still pursue it are generally imbeciles:  people with an extremely low IQ.   Many are drug addicts too.  Do you not remember that Nazi couple that had all of their children taken away from them by the state of New York 4 years ago?   The state proved that they were morons, and unfit parents who beat their children.   These are the kinds of stupid idiots that follow the Nazi ideology today.

eng_test_3702	The extraordinary mess that is health care in the U.S. is the result of the rigid and irrational beliefs by a majority of politicians, or the beliefs or interests of those who finance their election campaigns, that the free market is the best way to deal with social problems, failing to understand that social problems are considerably more complex than running a business in markets where the ultimate or only goal is to make a profit.
eng_test_3703	Does the same rationale not apply to OAS
eng_test_3704	Illegal.  And illegal.   And your 'valuation' for a lower-level city employee's 'bennies' is just totally ignorant ranting without any knowledge whatsoever.
eng_test_3705	Yeah! Those stupid melty snowflakes.
eng_test_3706	Silly child, of course people that eat processed foods are going to have health problems. Why don’t you stop making dumb generalizations for today?

Seems pretty clear he has the authority. If this law was unconstitutional, why didn't the judges say so? This law was not shot down or even addressed by the 9th Circuit. In fact, it was not mentioned even once in the 29-page opinion issued by the 9th Circuit. Oversight? Intentional omission? Who knows, but the Supreme Court will overturn their ruling accordingly on these grounds alone.

eng_test_3723	I couldn't agree more with this article.  I've been teaching part time at one of the colleges in their engineering technology programs.  I have had classes where upwards of 20% of the students have some sort of special needs accommodations, anything from requiring extra time on tests to having a service dog for comfort at all times to having students be able to set their own due dates for assignments.  The number of students who are on anxiety medication is frightening!  I don't know what is going on but we are under specific orders to accommodate even the most rediculous requests or we risk the personal liability of being hauled before a kangaroo court at the Human Rights Commission and having to hire our own legal defence in that case.  How these people ever will be able to hold down a job is a mystery to me, but that question is also taboo at the college where the councilling department seems to now be running the show.

eng_test_3727	Overweight was once associated with age.  Apart from the occasional "fat kid" on the school-ground (the one that was usually standing while others were running or skipping) overweight was something that afflicted adults, as they eat ate even more they did at age 15,  drank alcohol, "didn't have time" for "physical nut" stuff like exercise and finally, avoided it because "it hurt."  I know what the writer's getting at with physical exercise being "natural" with the young, but this kid was no athlete.  I sat. Was a reader and TV obsessive, (LOTS of screen time) but when you grow fast and continuously, you burn calories just standing still.  My life-changing secret? Walking to and from school (at least 20 min. each way) five days a week for 12 years. Air cadet parade square drill sure helped ("lift those arms!")  The foundation for a lifetime of fitness. At age 70 I still walk and hike.  This also helped: very few desserts (which mom made), no pizza, and pop and candy very occasionally.

eng_test_3731	That is not what he said. Posting your usual falsehoods.
eng_test_3732	Well, the business community had their chance with the economy and failed - big. Then it took a community organizer/Harvard-educated lawyer/civil rights attorney/constitutional lawyer/3-term state senator/2-term president to fix it, find stability despite a non-cooperative senate/house, and produce 8 years of economic/job growth with unprecedented (in history) stock market returns.  Maybe give the high school teacher a chance? Pretty sure he's not doing it all himself, and Canada has a darn good track record of financial stability. We are in a select club of just 12 countries that have a AAA (S&P) credit rating after all.
eng_test_3733	Seriously? This drink is one of the most offensive, nightmarishly tacky named, ignorant concoctions in the history of insulting drink names.  And you are gleefully promoting it?

As an Irish woman I am beyond horrified at your celebration and glorification of one of the most tragic and violent events in my country's history.

I believe they are being empowered by Pres. Trump and his alt-right advisers.

eng_test_3737	Physical Retailers need to learn from their virtual competitors and bring in better inventory management systems.  I do not understand why in most clothing stores if one store wants to check if another has an item in stock they need to pick up the phone and call.  If they are linked on a central POS system the numbers should be available in the system including colour and size (essential what you get online).  I get that shrinkage may cause the numbers to occasionally be out of wack but most large retails appear to have not updated their POS systems since Windows 95 came on the scene.  If they actually tracked the inventory then they could move it around to locations where specific sizes and colours are in demand instead of being stuck at the end of season.  It would also allow for better ordering in sizes.

eng_test_3747	How pathetic of Kellie Leitch to compare her Roman Catholic identity to Muslims in Canada.  Catholics have been here from the beginning days of this country....they are totally accepted, even though you do read mocking comments on the Internet at times, it is nothing at like experienced by Muslim people.  I'm Catholic.....I've never been personally insulted on a bus or taking a child to school or shopping in a grocerty store the way some newcomers to Canada are.    How silly of Ms. Leitch to make such a comparison....it's embarrassing actually.
eng_test_3748	Mr. Hill: The city can live within the current rail budget with a design change that includes conversion from steel wheels on steel rails (SWSR) to urban magnetic levitation (maglev) rail, a change that can deliver a full 20-mile alignment for the $6.8 billion in available funds. Ms. Graham: Those of us who propose maglev would be pleased to describe to Governor Ige how a maglev conversion can be accomplished. If you want more affordable housing, you should oppose ever-increasing spending on SWSR. TOD works just as well around a maglev station. By the way, those who will live in affordable housing near the rail alignment would be much happier with the much quieter maglev. Ms. Culvyhouse: I share your outrage and would be most pleased to vote for Jill Tokuda if she decides to run for a statewide office next year.

eng_test_3750	I understand about 9000 members voted on Saturday so the speeches were probably not decisive but would have helped Scheer somewhat.  You are right IMO that Andrew gave a crackerjack speech on Friday especially in his attacks on The Clown Prince.  Probably Scheer will get even better sharpening his attacks on Trudeau  and this is vital to success in 2019 since the media will mostly continue to give Justin a free pass and since the popularity of the Liberal government is pretty much all Trudeau and his celebrity.  A flat economy in 2019, more moronic and embarrassing behaviour by Trudeau, a huge accumulated debt,  more broken promises and at least a modest revival of the NDP will make the Liberals vulnerable.  Assuming voters decide they want change and conclude the PM has failed to meet expectations, a strong campaign by Scheer will bring victory.  The opening Liberal spin that Scheer is a placeholder candidate until a 2020 Ambrose-MacKay race is simply ridiculous.
eng_test_3751	Good post.  I also think "the media" bears much of the blame in the polarization.  Being just a little extreme, either right or left, increases viewership/readership and increases revenue via advertisement sales.  It also increases the demonization and alienation of the other "side", by the other "side", further increasing the divide.  for example,  Fox news is the most-watched newscast in the US, and it's not because all viewers lean right.  Many lefties love to watch Fox, so they can get in their daily dose of indignation and self-righteous serotonin burst.  I'm waiting and hoping for the first politician to come along that actually is a centrist.  In his policies, Trump is, unfortunately his darker side keeps taking front and centre.    This article is an excellent start to a much needed and much better conversation.

Any race here unlawfully needs to have deportation proceedings initiated per Title 8 of the U.S. Code section 1225(b)(2)(A) It reads: "“if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a [removal] proceeding under section 1229a of this title"  It doesn't say anything about race. And implying only a "certain" race is here unlawfully is racist in itself.

eng_test_3763	Oh and your argument is idiotic. If a party of and for the rich couldn't win elections in America the GOP would not have had any presidents at all after Teddy Roosevelt - the last liberal republican president.  Yet they've won often in the century since. By having all the wealthy votes and convincing half the poor people that their problems are caused by other poor people rather than policies which unjustly favor the rich. The only difference was that Trump named those people. But the story was always the same. Do you think Reagan's 'welfare queen' was white? But Reagan and the Bushes spoke of 'welfare queens' and 'gang violence' and 'radical Islamic terrorism' . Trump just said 'Mexicans and Muslims'.  That's not a change. It means the exact same thing. It's what conservatives have always voted for. Remember we had a conservative party in South Africa too : the guys who left the National party because apartheid wasn't racist enough for them!
eng_test_3764	Only recently has the taking of brown (grizzly) bears at bait stations been allowed by regulation, resulting in an increase in stations next to the national park, where there were few to none before. Only time will tell how this practice will affect recreation both on state and national park lands in the area. The behavior of some bait station operators has been less than exemplary as well.

eng_test_3779	Using term 'deadliest beach' is misleading and many people will interperet it as most dangerous beach. Article shows lack of statistical and mathematical knowledge. Article compares absolute #'s of drownings, not the percentages per visitor count per beach. Example: Poipu has many more swimming visitors per annum than Lumahai on the North Shore. Any lonely visitor to Lumahai has a good chance of ending up in a watery grave.... however, great numbers have had safe swimming experiences at Poipu unscathed. Finally, this is not a good topic for a sensational headline. Hopefully the writer doesn't endanger people's lives with the article... Here's a safer sensational headline "nobody ever drowned on a beach in hawaii" (people only drown in water)

Hello: According to international standars such an illegal referendum was a shame of a farse that disowned the silent majority that don´t want to separate from Spain. That isn´t Franco´s ... ! That is common sense that, twice in the last weeks, went out in mass, in an fantastic outpouring of support for an inclusive - not an exclusive, chi chi fanatical, victimist - Catalonia. Those are facts to deal with, and - in the forthcoming elections to be held in December - 63% of the Catalonians at least, are going to vote for integration with Spain, not for an exclusive chi chi club of victimism that held an illegal referendum.
eng_test_3782	If the leases are initially long-term (i.e. one year) then month-to-month, they are following the law regarding renters. You can rent rooms out of your house all you want, just have to apply for a business license and pay the GET. As the article mentions, with a separate contract for medical care, again they are following the law. To close this "loophole" you would have to radically alter rental law and renter's rights within the state.

eng_test_3786	Over all good article, but it missed a major point on why this is happening.  Most houses in Manoa get handed down, few go on the market.  Also since you can live in Manoa and seldom leave the valley, the elderly (my parents among them) can live independently in their houses later into their lives.    According to Oahu Re there are only 8 homes for sale right now in the entire valley and only 26 sold or in escrow all year. Compare this to Palolo (which is half the size of Manoa) which also has 8 homes on the market, but 51 homes either sold or in escrow this year.  Low inventory of course also drives up price, which means the people who can afford those homes that do go to market will be older.  There is, also, no place to build new houses.  I would expect Manoa to start getting younger in a decade or so as the homes built in the 60s start getting passed down to the next generation.

I really do appreciate the scientific endeavor and...talk the language. If this was about creating plants that are drought-resistant, I'd be all for it. But I realized...that's not what's in the ground in U.S. soil. What's in the ground are herbicide-resistant crops, and it's just going to get worse. That's what got me into this fight. Q. Does your company stand to benefit economically if GMO labeling passes? A. Obviously not. We're a soap company, and it's not like this is driving people toward soap. We contribute to causes we believe in, and that involves things such as organic agriculture...But will we make money off this? No."

Think of it.  No need to fly into Juneau, but simply drive 50 miles or so whether the location be in Anchorage or the Valley, to voice unto these idiots what the populace, or citizenship, truly thinks.  We, all of us, deserve that access unto the morons that have thus far hidden so far, far away.  Imagine that.  They no longer have the distance, the isolation, the familiarity of which they now have.  They must now, actually, answer unto the citizens that they, all of them, claim to represent.  And with NO PER DIEM, beyond the 90 day period that they are elected to conclude our business within.  Heck, I would even suggest that said lawmakers were locked in for those 90 days until they came unto an agreement, as the voting for the Pope goes.

He looks weak, indecisive, insincere, and untrustworthy. He should be asked the obvious question:  If you are re-elected, will you then propose to extend the GET surcharge to complete the project?  If not, how do you propose to "find the money" to complete the project? Djou should be asked the same questions.  He has only stated that he would veto any "new" taxes.  Would a further extension of the surcharge be a "new" tax to him, or an extension of an existing tax? Is it really so outlandish to even consider extending the GET, if that's what's needed to complete this project?

Those businesses will have no legal way to get their products tested unless someone opens a lab on Kodiak or Juneau, which isn't likely since there aren't even any testing lab applications pending there. This is just setting those businesses up to fail, since there's no way they can comply with the legal requirements for sales.

So in other words, the Liberals are the high priced call girls while the CPC were the less expensive street walkers?     Is THAT the difference?  Face it - "cash for access" is a sensationalist way to describe fundraising when a politician attends their own fundraiser.     It's been going on for as long as politicians needed money and there is nothing inherently wrong with it.    Further, eliminating it doesn't solve one damn thing.

eng_test_3833	Government provides the funding for basic medical research.    Drug companies take promising  ideas, that is potentially profitable ones, from universities and hospitals and conduct clinical trials which if successful will allow their sale and afford them patent protection.  Those who fund the trials are those who stand to profit and choose who will conduct the trials.  Those who conduct the trials therefore have an incentive to produce favourable results.  In addition, drug companies are not required to publish the results of studies that are not favourable.   Companies spend far more money on marketing their products, of which conferences are part, than they do on research and development.  It's time that Health Canada cleaned up the system.
eng_test_3834	Is that why the conservatives use it also? Your blame game blinds you to the hypocrisies it builds.
eng_test_3835	Well said, Ira,   but money invested in UA's capability  to do hard science research that attracts third-party grants has lots of secondary benefits to the school and the state.  That needs to be factored in when setting the UA budget long-term.

eng_test_3842	What's interesting is that the federal government funding covers diagnostic tests under provincial health care.     It raises interesting questions about who is determining the thresholds for determining test result outside ranges.   The labs?  The federal govt?  The provinces?  Who?   The B12 serum test is covered under health care and yet the range is dramatically different from the ranges used in Northern Europe and Japan, where the incidence of Alzheimer Disease is much lower.   The fact that the lower threshold in Canada is 138 ng/mL versus 500 ng/mL in Japan (not to mention ranges in Northern European countries) should raise big questions.  Alzheimer is just one piece of the picture.   B12 deficiency can be misdiagnosed as a wide range of diseases.   It is the most complex vitamin, and it has effects in all of the major systems in the body.   Deficiency triggers problems depending on genetic SNPs (snips or anomalies).   Alzheimer is just one of a long list of conditions.

NOT ONE ALASKAN HAS PROFITED!  Not one Alaskan or smaller competitors has EVER been able to make a profit from exploring and selling oil and gas because the system is rigged!   If this crooked oil and gas system was corrected so Alaskans can drill and sell oil for a profit then others could join!

My point is that, really, it is none of my, nor your, business.  Unless you observe the activity, or if they proclaim their sexual preferences, you have no way of discriminating against the person.  Black Americans do not have this ability to hide their status.

This statement from the original G&M article wouldn't make it as poor attempt to a second runner up twice removed at a podunk county fair poetry contest.  Just another reason I don't subscribe to the G&M.  And one of the reasons I very seldom even read the free articles.  The writing is rubbish, absolute rubbish.
eng_test_3875	What's "eSports"? Sitting on your butt, pretending to do something?
eng_test_3876	OMB & BLM have pushed to eliminate the requirement for BLM to survey Native (State) lands prior to conveyance.  The cost would shift from the Feds to land owners. Congress mandated in ANCSA 13(a) that BLM survey the exterior boundaries of ANCSA lands and State lands so they receive Patent to surveyed land.  BLM regs & policy change, but only Congress can amend Federal law. Kornze said "If someone else wants to know how we can save $3 million a year and continue improving the quality of work we're doing, I'm all ears." Contracting State surveys to private firms instead of BLM doing the work in house will realize much of that cost savings. Private survey contractors and BLM surveyors use GPS for most of the surveying; cutting the cost of the work in half. But the final results, physical monuments in the ground at reasonable intervals and density has not changed.  Using BLM’s new DPPS the bulk of the corner markers and traditional record systems disappear.  We don't want "Virtual Survey"
eng_test_3877	Shadar, thank you for your input. The fluorides that are introduced naturally are calcium fluorides, which have significantly different effects on the body and health than the silicofluorides that are added by municipalities. Silicofluorides are a hazardous waste and are used as poisons in other applications. I am sure there will still be latent affects of these artificially added substances found in the soils and in the drinking water, but it is an important first step to stop the intentional inclusion of them into the ecological system.
eng_test_3878	Caldwell and his people are the most stinky swamp.  The odor of corruption and abuse are overwhelming.
eng_test_3879	Drucker is dumb as a rock. Nobody "forced" Danforth to say something as stupid and offensive as "There hasn't been a more divisive person in national politics since George Wallace." And Trump was right on Charlottesville, so these "midterm Republicans" needed to back him rather than back the Democrat yawp that you couldn't mention the Communist antifas (who were actually MORE at fault) in the same sentence as the white supremacists.  Back Trump or lose. Nothing "awkward" about that. It's a promise.
eng_test_3880	Silly if you only make 40 thousand a year. Remember the one percenters. One in a hundred can afford this type of car and are quite comfortable spending the money.
eng_test_3881	A stupid post by a troll.  Thanks for outing yourself.
eng_test_3882	Sniffle, sniffle  Ted Cruz proved tonight he's an ass.  All you crying delegates must want to cuddle with the bitch Hillary
eng_test_3883	Alaskans, protect dividend and get oil corporation taxes. There is no free lunch, except for the oil companies.
eng_test_3884	The states where Hillary was projected to win, that Trump actually won, were all won, well within the margin of error of the polls.
eng_test_3885	Yes, the president has business interests to worry about, not dumb Remember the Alamo! stuff.
eng_test_3886	No, I graduated with a dual masters in history and political science many years ago. I know poppycock when I see it!! And you are all bull poo. Today's democrats and their voters are socialist. Read history and political platforms. Nazis are socialist. So are communist, the Nazis were right of communism. Therefore the liberals of America took advantage of the term right wing of the right socialist in Germany. If you disagree your either intellectually dishonest or stupid. Pick your poison.
eng_test_3887	It looked like the other way around. The FNs were in their face. Check out the video
eng_test_3888	Next time this happens Ann, I here volunteer YOU -- to be the first to drive by the dude while he's ranting and waving a gun around. When you're safely past, phone back the all clear.  PS - Yeah, spit eventually happens to all of us that interferes with normal life.
eng_test_3889	so now we want liars and criminals as migrants.why have any laws for immigrants if we forgive liars and free loaders
eng_test_3890	this is from a man whose only fame comes from being a sock puppet for an FBI beaurocrat
eng_test_3891	I think what the author is saying, is the vacuous stupidity of the average voter knows no borders.
eng_test_3892	Throwing bottles out a seven story window could be called murder or man slaughter if it was to hit someone in the head.
eng_test_3893	Good point.  Perhaps hotel owners should be required to pay into a demolition fund that will be in place should they go bankrupt and abandon the property in the future.
eng_test_3894	JBC TTMLB.  Do you care to clarify?  Or is this just an AI scam?
eng_test_3895	I'd like to challenge you to do your homework before lobbing stupid comments, Hood.  If you did your homework you'd find that municipal employees are known to take pay cuts or freezes.  The last election, rational and ethical voters threw their support behind municipal employees, and that was while Sully was mayor.  What does that tell you?  Yer Robin Hood alright; telling lies and giving them to weak, uniformed voters.  Ruff.
eng_test_3896	"Republicans are a bunch of frightened rabbits," Giuliani said. "Unfortunately, we have a party made up of a bunch of people who get frightened very easily, and their hands start to shake whenever something happens that they don't like."  Ding, ding, ding, dingggggg!!!!!!  Yup. You can't spend the last thirty years scaring the crap out of our oldsters for votes and not think that it might come back to bite you someday.
eng_test_3897	Thanks Obama for doing nothing while this human tragedy continues to unfold.  So much for your "red line" in the sand.    You will be remembered as one of the worst presidents the USA has ever had.  How many more days before your gone...........can't wait.
eng_test_3898	Just listen to the PM! Is that not justification enough for the ridicule and criticism he receives? The man is an intellectual lightweight, a luddite, a troglodyte.

eng_test_3903	What suckers will you put in the cockpits of the Widowmakers?
eng_test_3904	I can't even take this garbage seriously. Stop the identity politics - "we need more like her because she's a woman". No, she gives women a bad name, because she is a terrible person. You want a female democrat (as God knows you won't praise any female Republican) to praise? Tulsi Gabbard. Very promising start to her political career, seems bipartisan, and she's a veteran.
eng_test_3905	Let's hear it for pussy power!
eng_test_3906	They've had nine years to plan this and get rid of the crucial evidence so that, even if he did face his charges in court, there would be nothing left to prove him guilty with. Genius! Failing that, he has so many other backup plans for every contingency that he'll be as untouchable as ever. What a wretch.
eng_test_3907	He looked and sounded like an idiot.  I hope someone will help him with his crayons.
eng_test_3908	BUT, the nation, or at least what appears to be a very loud, vast and diverse majority of the nation, (including GOP leaders), coalesced and united AGAINST Trump.  Interesting Trump would let the nation unite against him.  Especially on this issue.  It doesn't just go away.  It may be a new political gut ckeck.  Kinda stupid, actually.  What does this portend?
eng_test_3909	Be patient Bob Mueller will and believe me the moron is going down.
eng_test_3910	Nobody said they hate old white men, but honestly Corbeil, we are waiting patiently for the racist ones to die off.

eng_test_3914	keep crying loser, we are laughing at you every time,,, ding dong left wingers gone!!!  hey bud, you have not one clue or fact that supports the fantasy you post, trump has already kept jobs in the usa from leaving, a great start to his legacy of a booming economy there!! but you keep crying ok~!
eng_test_3915	No, the conversation doesn't go like that short circuit in your brain.      And, your attempt at superior sarcasm makes you to be a fool, instead.
eng_test_3916	I agree with you. But let's keep in mind that agribusinesses worth at least a trillion dollars want those undocumented workers laboring in their lettuce fields, and have the lobbying clout to prevent their removal or legal status that would give them any rights to complain about work conditions.  There's a lot of money tied up in keeping them in a near-slave status.
eng_test_3917	Or ...........  I inherited billions. The rest of you are bums
eng_test_3918	Yes much smarter to act like Harper and fight it in court. Triple the cost. My god can you imagine how much you'd whine then?
eng_test_3919	There is no middle ground?  Scrap them or keep them?  Seems simplistic.  Turn down the sensitivity in my opinion.
eng_test_3920	The Swamp is large and largely it is the Congress.  A complete  draining the swamp would  have included pulling the plug on the Congress. It didn't by a long shot. Same makeup, same swamp.
eng_test_3921	The impotent Poloz will never raise rates unless the Loonie falls to US$0.10.  We seem to have nothing but incompetent fools running the Bank of Canada, from Free Money Carney to Toothless Poloz.
eng_test_3922	There is some weird backlash against science happening. There are degrees of this stupidity and flat Earthers are at the far end of the spectrum, but are they really any different than other head in the sand deniers? I don't really think they are.  The scariest part of this is the movements to legitimize their beliefs. Like pushes to teach creationism in schools as an equivalent alternate explanation for things. Flat Earters feel they've been discriminated against, but so what? People don't like to be around morons.
eng_test_3923	Most of the comments here are brainless and useless. For some actual intelligent suggestions about what to do, see the responses to this article on the Homeless in Eugene page on Facebook.   https://www.facebook.com/groups/278733372196382/  Too bad the reporter, Dylan Darling, didn't bother to talk to some of the homeless and their advocates. That's a pattern with the RG.
eng_test_3924	So Lefties think The American People are so stupid , that after Lefties submitted wire-tap evidence  to The Court of Flynn talking to Russians from Trump Tower,  that these so called 'dumb American People' will believe the Alt-Left  didn't bug Trump Tower?
eng_test_3925	Yeah-- to most of us, this shows that Car2Go business model wasn't working, so now they're trying something else completely different.  UBER and car-sharing services are really just one more float in a parade of fictional California pipe-dreams that are targeted at millennial market share and gullible investor's wallets.  ...Tesla's, anyone?
eng_test_3926	“As far as we know, there wasn’t vetting of the order outside of a small, obviously incompetent circle of advisers in the White House,” he said. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  In crafting his executive order, Trump and his cabal didn’t consider the implications of it. They didn’t care if it violated the Constitution. They didn’t even consult the Attorney General (responsible for interpreting it) or the officials charged with implementing it. The inmates have truly taken over the asylum.
eng_test_3927	Critical: You seem to have been posting now for 24 hours straight.  Her's hoping that the Liberals let you take a rest over the holidays.
eng_test_3928	its those damn hippies fault
eng_test_3929	Yes one must muse, the Russians are simple guilty for being Russians and America is innocent  Oh yes its the Russians fault crooked Hillary lost, they forced America to view RT news and brain washed the deplorable s  to vote Trump, what a joke !!!
eng_test_3930	Another Taliban supporter.   Shameful.
eng_test_3931	I notice you didn't dispute the fact that Hillary is a lying murderer.  Instead you go back tot he intellectually lazy "Bush lied too".  Unfortunately your logic and debating skills are typical for a low-information kool aid drinking democrat.
eng_test_3932	Seems these profoundly stupid crooks had a strong desire to spend time behind bars. They accomplished absolutely nothing to enrich themselves, and with a highly distinctive car full of "loot" that was captured on the required pot shop video cams, they made it very easy for the police to build a case against them.   Must have taken a lot of beer to plan such a great heist.
eng_test_3933	At this point, I don't care why anyone is against this travesty, as long as it stops the fucking Republicans from crippling America.
eng_test_3934	Probaly a good idea you give up sitting on your derirre every weekend. Time to talk a walk, read a book, learn some history instead of wrapping yourself up in stupidity the rest of your life.
eng_test_3935	Traitor. Lock him up.
eng_test_3936	Hope they simulcast on channel 20 for directv people
eng_test_3937	We've never had a bigger idiot in the WH.
eng_test_3938	Aren't we supposed to be better than that? Either the US holds true to its values or it sinks to the lowest standard.   I know where Trump is heading but is that where most Americans want go if they really think about it?
eng_test_3939	Your selfish ignorance is only matched by your abstract cynicism. Both bits of darkness leave you worse off and feeling disgusted about yourself and others. If it was only about money why not fund coal?
eng_test_3940	After he stabbed Americans in the back on the Obamacare vote he should just stay in Italy until the Devil takes him to Hell.
eng_test_3941	Such denial. Bravo!  Such hypocrisy. You voted for Trump, a man who belongs to the GOP, a party that epitomizes everything you rant against in your post.   Such a load.  Spare us your poor widdle fake hurt feewings, Trump Bunny.   Grow up.
eng_test_3942	“Would it be better than Obama­care? Yeah. But that’s not the goal. The goal is to replace Obamacare.”  ....right. Better for who? The rich who don't like the extra taxes? Or the people who will be faced with bankruptcy or staying alive?
eng_test_3943	Your racist comments are disgusting.
eng_test_3944	From what I have often seen, the physical fitness test is either ignored or the candidate really piled on the donut pounds soon after being hired.
eng_test_3945	There are your standard con artists like used car salesmen and then there is a whole other class of con artists like Wynne who are a combination of plain stupid/ignorant and who pretend they don't know what's going on in order to implement their agenda and garner votes.  Tell me which are more costly to society overall ?
eng_test_3946	Oh ive made multiple accounts, thats never a problem.    However they are way way way way way way way too negative for my tastes.  Everybody sucks, no hope for a winning season, Elway is stupid, Kubes is stupid, Bronco Fans are stupid.... its like they need antidepressants.  Besides, they banned all the smart people last year for liking siemian.  I used to read it for information.  The truly intelligent posters no longer frequent the site.  Now its just a trolling party.  So im back at the DP.  Happily.
eng_test_3947	Find the numbers? I can make numbers up anytime I choose, just like you. That's a good saying. Over here in 'muricca we say: "Don't wrestle with a pig. You get muddy, and the pig enjoys it! Selah.
eng_test_3948	Fear mongering bullshit yellow journalism
eng_test_3949	Minimum wage increases are far more insidious than than what has been posted here. For example, if Company A's costs are $1.00 to put a product on the market and they want 10% profit, cost of the item is $1.10. If the cost increases due to minimum wage to $1.10, the 10% profit now makes the item $1.21. That increase is, of course, passed on to the consumer. Now look what happens. The business' gross increases, which means they have to pay higher taxes at the end of the year. The minimum wage worker also has to pay higher taxes, and that increase outpaces the gains made by the minimum wage worker. The result? More tax money to the state and the worker falls even further behind. But wait, there's more. Many union wages are ties to minimum wage, meaning that their pay is based on a percentage added to minimum wage, i.e., their wages go up, forcing those companies to raise their prices. More tax dollars go to the state(and Fed.) But wait, there's more...
eng_test_3950	Yep, the Russians are laughing all right......at the incompetent clown in the WH and the minority of voters who fell for his con man scheme.
eng_test_3951	Ignorance of the ignorant does not make it right either.... Lawyers can make the ignorant look like a hero...
eng_test_3952	Trump anything is a disgrace and Donald Trump Jr is the biggest disgrace other than his father. I like Kahn's response when informed of this ridiculousness.
eng_test_3953	Are you sure he wasn't speaking about the United States election?
eng_test_3954	The extra week is nothing more than a part of the city's rubber stamp program, the "we feel for the neighborhood" exercise of giving an extra week of consideration, when it's a foregone conclusion, it's a done deal. It's a given that any objections by those who live and have a direct interest will be overrode for the almighty dollar of a New York based outfit, and the satchel of cash that they bring is all the city really cares about. The city of Denver is for sale, and has been for years under the current people in power, from developers to this current issue at Overland Golf Course.
eng_test_3955	If gender were replaced by race in this clueless memo, there would be no discussion over his firing.   Explaining why another race is not "biologically" equipped to work at Google would be outrageous, sadly people on this comment board are defending a memo stating just such a thing about women.  How does this memo make women working at Google feel?  By writing such a stupid memo, this man, ironically, reveals himself not fit to work at Google.
eng_test_3956	"To options"..??  or 'two'..??  or 'Too'..??
eng_test_3957	I spent all of last winter in Vancouver renovating a downtown condo and I can honestly say there was never more than 2 cm. on the ground at any one time.  Are you indicating Abbotsford, Surrey or the top of Grouse Mountain?
eng_test_3958	I always find it pathetic people like you write these comments . If you have no interest in basketball then why are you reading and posting a comment in the First place ?!? oh yeah because the Leafs are eliminated...again!
eng_test_3959	HOORAY FOR OBAMA!  For protecting our environment from the EVIL GREEDY people who only care about money and themselves and don't care what damage (e.g. Prince William Sound) they do! . OBAMA WILL HAVE A GREAT LEGACY! . SHAME ON YOU EVIL OIL DRILLERS AND ENVIRONMENT KILLERS WHO ARE TOO DIM-WITTED TO KNOW YOU ARE ACTIVELY SLITTING YOUR OWN THROAT...DUMMIES!
eng_test_3960	Trump is a pathological liar who routinely lies about things big and small, regardless of reality because he knows his dim-witted followers will believe everything he says.   My opinion that Trump supporters are not just uninformed, but are actually stupid is based upon the following: When one is ignorant, that can be remedied by seeking out knowledge and retaining it. When one is stupid, one is not only proud of one's ignorance but actively refuses to become informed and scorns fact-based education.
eng_test_3961	I do not agree with this article's premise but Hillary sure is a lousy candidate and dirty dealer; an Alinskyite scumbag who won't shut up.
eng_test_3962	Oh, and I should add one more compelling purpose of this bit of idiocy (and all that will follow): stop Trump from accomplishing anything and, fingers crossed, get him out of office ASAP. Establishment types of all stripes can unite around that!
eng_test_3963	hey loser, parents dont IMPOSE the gender a baby is born too, god you lunatics are sick and stupid

eng_test_3968	The corporate left. You know how silly that sounds?
eng_test_3969	Also Ervin is pointed out as black n the story. Why didnt they point out that he is also native american or jewish? Do native americans not deserve their race to b spotlighted?!  The guy looks hispanic to me! Let others decide the race not that it matters. If the  newspaper wants to make this event about race then they should include all the races and cultures! Its all so stupid. This journalist deserves the gold medal stupid award!
eng_test_3970	I'm a lawyer and so am accustomed to judges receiving expert evidence and having to decide how it will affect their decision. Consequently, I have no problem with decision makers taking advice form multiple sources and choosing which advice to follow. You can be sure that this particular council is not the government's only source of advice on this topic, and other experts will disagree with these experts.
eng_test_3971	Hard to tell the difference between a Trump press conference and an SNL routine.
eng_test_3972	You could install windmills to generate clean power on the wind from the fans!
eng_test_3973	Do you trust ANYTHING released by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives? They're an ideologically driven left wing echo-chamber.
eng_test_3974	No, the Morally bankrupt  shysters who lie as a rule not as exception do not deserve our trust or support. They have caused untold problems with their pandering to special interests that will take decades to recover from.  Bye Bye lying liars who lie constantly
eng_test_3975	OMG!  You were driving a car!  Don't do that ... the exhaust will cause the Antarctic ice sheet to melt and the Homer Spit will be lost under the ocean!  And you will look like a hypocrite fool as you drive a vehicle that is powered by the product of fracking.
eng_test_3976	And power consumption will only increase after marijuana is decriminalized.  Those plants is our basements would wilt if we shut the lights off.   Suck and blow Justin.
eng_test_3977	The US won the war in the Pacific. Micronesians suffered from invasions, occupations and subjugation. The US took responsibility for these Islands via the UN & TTPI. At termination of the TTPI, the US performed a study to identify how much money would be required to update infrastructure (hospitals, schools, roads, water, sewage, power, airports, to U.S. standards. The amount was staggering. Congress did not fund the COFA (Compact of Free Association) to that extent. Mellen is right. These states cannot be self-sufficient. They cannot raise capital and have little to export. Their natural resources can support  tourism, but that is not enough. The CNMI appears on track with hundreds of millions of hot money being invested for casinos and resorts. That outcome has been money laundering, human trafficking foreign birthing. Foreign vessel registrations and money laundering seems to work in the Marshalls. The US needs a presence in the Pacific, Congress has to fund it.
eng_test_3978	Any Canadian who went to fight for ISIS or any other Islamist terrorist group, and who returns to Canada, should be immediately incarcerated for a minimum of 25 years and let out only when they are guaranteed to be not a threat to any person.  It would be better, of course, if they were just wiped-out in Syria.
eng_test_3979	hang 'em high...
eng_test_3980	This is just a drop in the bucket.CRA does not have the resources to adequately tackle this problem and flipping will continue much like before , just as prices will continue to rise further out of reach for those with average incomes.
eng_test_3981	ALL public sector pensions need to be revamped. They all have underfunded liabilities which will be up to the taxpayer to subsidize. Mathematical they are unsustainable. Retiring at age 55 and collecting longer than you contributed is no longer an option.
eng_test_3982	What happened to a recount of ballot instead of hiring lawyers?
eng_test_3983	It so ridiculous to think that improving the nuclear arsenal could be done in six months, especially by this incompetent and chaotic White House.
eng_test_3984	More taxes mean more monies for the homeless. This is what happens when Kirk gets his people in the city council.
eng_test_3985	You are right Jack and the Liberal government has now allowed our spending on National Defense to slip below 1% of GDP. Pathetic.
eng_test_3986	I didn't vote for Hillary not because my husband dad or brothers cared. I didn't vote for her because she is pure evil. She lies steals and only looks out for herself. She doesn't care one iota about anyone but being President. So glad she lost. Now if she would just quietly fade into the back ground.
eng_test_3987	huh? Yup vote your Racial makeup, Nationality, unAmerican values, etc. the thing is Joe/Jill 6pack took it up their... and may have had enough of it.
eng_test_3988	I hear that more corps. are having trouble finding employees who test clean on marijuana such as CA techies. Some of the most creative are users. So corps had to lighten up. Unemployment rate is historically low, workers have more opportunity to shift. If an employer tests at the initial hiring, many do not test subsequently such as the post office, some stores, RG? (per the grapevine).   More may start their own businesses to avoid working for the man and his antiquated ways. Cannabis Culture could mean a sea shift in the very concept of work or right livelihood. Youth of today may want to enjoy life more, may not require family wage jobs C of C, BOC, CC  promote. Home ownership out of reach of many it seems.  Ive sometimes wondered if some home schoolers in the past or even today do so to avoid kids tattling on them to teachers. Were kids sometimes ripped away from families if marijuana was found in their homes?  I think I recall this chapter in the history of selective persecution.
eng_test_3989	Trump feels best when smothered in love by his fawning cabinet. As vile and despicable as Sessions might be, his heart is in racism and nativism, not in the worship of BFF (big fat fraud) Trump and his spoiled-rotten kids.
eng_test_3990	"Whether it is 1 per 100 or 2 per 100, each additional 100 'homeless' would increase the actual number of violent people coming in."  But the number of housed people is also increasing in Eugene, has been for a long time. Since some portion of them are obviously violent, judging by the news, that will also increase the number of violent people here. So we're back to the question of whether the homeless are proportionally more violent than the housed. I don't know if anyone has the numbers, but I don't think so, just based on those I've met and other information.
eng_test_3991	How about people are sick and tired of the political-media entertainment class and being deceived by fake news and opinion pieces, created by fake journalists,created for the fake media. For being so smart the msm sure gets trolled by dumb old Trump an awful lot.
eng_test_3992	More missing the point - nowhere in the article does it state that they're not allowed to express an opinion, simply that when you make asinine statements and belong to a group with questionable knowledge about anything, then the world is going to call you out on it. These guys are idiots, and we're calling them out.
eng_test_3993	3 perfectly normal non racist white people out of 4 fear that a Muslim will blow them up.....
eng_test_3994	Spokane has a lot to offer and is a nice size city with a large metro area reach. We have a beautiful landscape with activities including skiing, boating, hunting, hiking, flying to the arts.  This article was a well written historical summary of our area and one I will be sharing with my clients who choose to locate here. Thank you for writing it!

eng_test_4000	Kudos to the Mounties.  They are not perfect, but they sure-as-hell do not have to dance to the latest (lame) pearl-clutching media outrage. This shit gets tiring. Really.   R

eng_test_4002	When people start implementing programs that actually work to curb addiction and the black market. But fear-based politics and for-profit prisons are a huge hurdle to that.
eng_test_4003	would be a great story if the owner had put one through the perps brain. maybe these punk ass thieves might take notice of who is in charge of what.
eng_test_4004	thanx for perpetuating the myopia but they certainly are not the only ones hurt or affected by various 'accidents' due to one or more parties. why is that so hard to comprehend?
eng_test_4005	Trump and his supporters are racist scum.
eng_test_4006	Cory not only proved what a spineless coward he is, but also what a miserable human being he has become.
eng_test_4007	Thomas DiGrazia is right. Climate change is getting worse. Just look at Houston. Pretty soon the South Pole will melt and oceans will rise 400 ft.
eng_test_4008	Feminists are men haters and selfish.
eng_test_4009	VOODOO, GIVE ME NOTHING BUT VOODOO. lol  What hypocrites the republicans are.  They have never seen a deficit they didn't like.  :-)
eng_test_4010	Your article is a real disservice to the many people hurt by people like Amber Batts.
eng_test_4011	Can we now hold Justin Trudeau to the same moral standard (or lack of it) for recent events in Scarborough?

eng_test_4013	Here is the problem. "As Medicaid expansion costs increase and Obamacare reimbursements decrease..." http://www.vaildaily.com/news/regional/dwindling-obamacare-funds-could-hurt-regional-medicaid-transit-program/  The feds promised funding and now have cut back (reneged in actuality) on what they promised insurance companies.  - 2015 [...] The risk corridors were intended to help some insurance companies if they ended up with too many new sick people on their rolls and too little cash from premiums to cover their medical bills in the first three years under the health law. But because of Mr. Rubio’s efforts, the administration says it will pay only 13 percent of what insurance companies were expecting to receive this year. The payments were supposed to help insurers cope with the risks they assumed when they decided to participate in the law’s new insurance marketplaces... https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/10/us/politics/marco-rubio-obamacare-affordable-care-act.html

eng_test_4016	Oh, so you can dish it out but you can't take it. Jump into my reply that was addressed to someone else, cut ME down by chastising my reply...then cry when I hit back. Typical double-standard liberal. Whatever. I'm not here to when a popularity contest, and you seem to live in a fantasy land where everything is supposed to be perfect.  You won't vote for such scum to be president...cool with me. Election's over so I don't know why you'all are griping about it. But, likewise, that's why I didn't vote for KILLery. Or should I say Crooked Hillary who STOLE the primaries from Bernie. I guess that shows your true character. But I'd much rather vote for an executive who never gave up even after failing and, in the process, continues to create hundreds -- if not thousands -- of jobs through his very successful ventures. Key phrase..."Never gave up even after failing."  Anyhow, make sure you make your comeback reply juicy, because I'm done with this nonsense.

eng_test_4026	The Dems are continuing to undermine Trump, so that he doesn't have the political support to take timely and effective action against N. Korea. Countries that play "brinkmanship" with us, do so because they know our country is politically divided, and can't initiate serious action.

He should be nothing but thankful he was removed from combat, got excellent medical treatment (for wounds the murdered US medic wanted to treat, instead got blown into pieces), and psych help (brainwashed hell-bent-on-killing-kuffars teenager rehabilitated to let's hope, let's just hope fairly normal adult). If he wasn't put in Gitmo to rehabilitate, he'd be DEAD now, just like his terrorist daddy. Hundreds of thousands $$ maybe millions already spent on keeping him in custody - his betterment, saving his life. He should be thanking his lucky stars this happened to him, he got a new lease on life... INSTEAD, this... UNBELIEVABLE. The whole Khadr family must be laughing and saying, "those idiot kuffars, we want to kill them and they in return apologize and give us millions of dollars, hahahaha"

If you don't allow development, the existing residents would need to pay higher taxes. If you allow development, the developers can pay along with their permitting fees, taxes remain the same.  This is a no brainer.

Just wanted to draw attention..it's in his DNA. All of them are called professionals because of receiving a salary to play a professional sport whether it be baseball, basketball or football to name a few, and many of them, their ego goes to their head and their actions are certainly unprofessional....always showboating and drawing attention.  Once a professional, act like a professional instead of like a kid wanting attention.  Notice who's always  acting up and has to do some kind of showboating after a good play or touchdown?  The real professionals don't have to do such an act, they continue to walk back to the bench or high five their teammates. KK needs a real job like working in a grocery store.

How can I look up something that  you claim has never been published? Ooops!  You painted yourself into a corner again.
eng_test_4078	Respectfully JSB1, you think AMBER COLLINS is DALE GROSS as well? I want you to know that I personally enjoyed the discussion with you, you made me think a bit more and want to research more on the PERA. With AMBER COLLINS. I just let it go, explain why, and be done. DALE GROSS did much the same, I felt sad that he was so inclined to insulting others personally.  Thank you for letting me suffer your patience with a differing view, that made this very enjoyable and most worthwhile! See you again here sometime!
eng_test_4079	The chance any of these students will be applying to McDonalds is about zero.  If you notice, a lot of the funding is a former student that runs his own company - that would be someone that grew up here, was educated here, and makes a living in a non-oil-company dependent profession.   Similarly, these are students learning to do it right in a way that will move them to the top of the list in several areas as job applicants - for good jobs.

eng_test_4083	Bring on Amazon, now that Denver is so prepared to invest in more bike lanes and dedicated bus lanes hours when RTD runs limited schedules. I agree that this was passed by ignorant renters that will be complaining about how unaffordable this city is to live in as property taxes continue to increase and passed on to them. RTD is a joke, CDOT is a joke, Denver is a joke, just a cowtown trying to make it into the big time. Lipstick on a pig...idiots.

eng_test_4085	I'm curious about that too. I can't tell whether the point of the $100,000 is back pay or a signing bonus of sorts. It is common and surprisingly successful for employers to offer a pile of cash to get union workers to approve an offer, so it could easily be the latter.

eng_test_4099	All those donations to Trump, go into his pocket, to pay off the loans he made to his campaign. He also holds all his events at Trump properties, and charges the campaign for their use, and for his 757 jet as well. SUCKERS!

eng_test_4101	A "real American" would reject a person like Donald Trump, who is completely unfit and unqualified to run a country. He needs a mental evaluation, and then once it's confirmed he's unfit to make decisions affecting our country and its citizens, he needs to be ousted. he's a racist, sexist, mentally incompetent, pathological liar who doesn't deserve any respect from anyone. Sad.
eng_test_4102	You guys are all,  still living in a world where you have not recognised the absolute, shit,  that is happening to our country.

eng_test_4111	T.O. Mann: you've been less than forthright in summarizing the remedial aspect of the 2010 SCC case the way.  That aspect of the decision was meticulously worded, even for the SCC, but amounts to:  'We're not going to make you repatriate him, government, we're going to leave it up to you to do the correct thing.    'When you are figuring out what that correct thing is - and listen very carefully here - remember that the impact of Canada's Charter violations are continuing to this day and, unless Khadr's circumstances change, will continue into the future.  Got it?"  They also added a statement that, to most people, indicated that a refusal to repatriate Khadr  NOW would further increase liability in the damages case.  The Harper government refused to bring him back for another 2 1/2 years.   ps, many of the British detainees had been held in Guantanamo about 1/5 the time Khadr spent.  Work it out.

eng_test_4114	It's frustrating to read comments about cost of investing when you really don't understand what you're writing or better put assuming. You have to understand that the return numbers in mutual funds are NET of fees. So critique the funds return vs it's peers then factor in the cost.  If you only look at cost you may very well over look a lot of good opportunities.

eng_test_4116	It’s not often I find myself agreeing with Renzetti, but in this case, I can’t agree more.  Who are these faceless arbiters of appropriation?  What qualifies them to denounce works of fiction as being not sufficiently authentic?  What metrics do they use?  Could they discern an “appropriated” work if the author wasn’t identified?  Is the pedigree of the author more important than the thoughts and feelings the work inspires in its readers?  Writers shouldn’t be told by anyone to climb back into their boxes any more than I should be told what I should be reading.
eng_test_4117	Isn't it just a crime that we live in a place with some of the world's best seafood (not an exaggeration!) and yet we almost consistently are sold sub-par seafood that is marketed as fresh?

There has been nothing to prove Trump colluded with Russia in any way shape or form. In fact the so-called dossier that started that nonsense has been totally discredited. If you are one of those that are hanging your hat on Trump getting impeached best rethink that position. Have a good day!
eng_test_4124	Slight correction:  Labour won about the same share of the popular vote in 2001 as it won in 2017.  Nevertheless, a clear repudiation of all those pundits who insisted Labour couldn't possibly make gains by running on a  left-wing programme. We were told it was going to be a repeat of Labour's 1983 election debacle. Not so.

eng_test_4132	Semple and Taylor are against it. That makes those who oppose this project on their side. No mention of councilor Clark, who I think would be for it as this is a business deal that would create jobs and spur growth. That seems a strange turn of events.  As it is now, the land does not provide much if any revenue. Besides the tax revenue the project could generate, we need people living downtown.  There is certainly a shortage of low-income housing. HACSA housing is of such high quality that few notice its presence. It seems to increase the value of the neighborhood because the property is maintained and the residents follow strict guidelines. Obie "Wan" Kenobi can benefit, especially since this will add customers to 5th Street Market. Some people just don't like a rich person making a profit, let alone with the help of a tax break. Seems weird to me since there is such reverence for tax breaks for the "job creators." Given what I know, I am slightly in favor of the project.

Who cares about the 2nd Judicial District they don’t have anything to do with Fairbanks that’s the fourth Judicial District dip shit now back to the matter at hand you’re BLATANT STUPIDITY AT THIS COMMENT.
eng_test_4139	But he is only doing it for the middle (Kingdom) class.
eng_test_4140	Proof please, not your opinion.
eng_test_4141	Welcome to the 1980's. Doctors said and did the same thing back then, nurses too, but the majority of them returned, many disillusioned. If the doctors in these pools can make a valid case on why they should pay less tax than everyone else, then let them make their case and stop threatening people.
eng_test_4142	Pathetic is a good description.
eng_test_4143	He must really take us all for suckers.
eng_test_4144	Banning Trump from Twitter is the pinnacle of stupidity.  These liberal activists are shooting themselves in the foot.  Twitter is full of idiots tweeting idiotic things and so President Trump fits right in.  As a bonus, his Twitter behavior has done more damage to himself than anyone else at this point.  Let the lunatic keep going.
eng_test_4145	Harris is a moron.  All of members of Congress, all justices of the US Supreme Court, and POTUS are co-equals.  POTUS is no one's lackey.
eng_test_4146	Sounds like police have been sleeping on the job, and we should eliminate the waste that is the police.
eng_test_4147	Cork in water: Judging from the number of comments, there remains a tremendous and robust  interest in this subject.
eng_test_4148	No, not "many sides". The white guys with the tiki torches, the Nazi salutes, the swastikas, the racist and anti-semitic chants that can't be printed here brought the violence. Staffing the White House with white supremacists and covert Nazis blowing dog whistles and winks and nods brought the violence. YOU, you ignorant buffoon, brought the violence.
eng_test_4149	Christians should be very, very careful using bible mythology to justify modern morality.  Remember, using the Holy Bible, Jesus was born a bastard.
eng_test_4150	POTUS would like to pay a visit to the left coast but the Governors and Mayors cannot guarantee his safety.
eng_test_4151	No one is making the argument that laws will make everyone safe from all crime. What we're saying is that the gun violence rate is far, far lower in countries that have taken strong stands against gun violence. Rather than actually promoting it, like our wonderful republicans.

eng_test_4155	Thank you for the links Truthbender. I will look at the Ottawa Forum stuff when I have some time. The thing that gets me about the first link is that Paris has a lot of ideas about how to reform our trade relations with our North American neighhbours. I'm not sure a customs union is the way to go, but it is an option, and it is what the EU has. So you would think by now he would be pretty peeved that Justin "Get the f--k out of my way" Trudeau hasn't taken any of his ideas on board. The full court press Trudeau talks about seems to be all about preserving the status quo. But Paris doesn't seem at all miffed about being ignored.  It seems odd that someone who obviously has a lot of ideas would show such dog-like loyalty to his not-so-great leader.
eng_test_4156	In my opinion this is for the most part fair, reasonable and thoughtful Editorial Comment  but it  have would  had much  more credibility if the name of  Donald Trump  were  simply left out.  Donald Trump ...  yadayadayada.   Did the Media get anything else for Christmas ?
eng_test_4157	Shut up slaves!
eng_test_4158	Just more BS from the Lying White House. The uranium deal was not only legitimate, it was not within Clinton’s sole authority to approve it. It had to be - and was - signed off by multiple entities. Sorry, Trump Nuts; that dog won’t hunt. Trump et al’s acts of treason are another thing entirely.  Same garbage with the emails.  Even as we speak, Trump’s Administration is using private emails to conduct illegal “White House” business. Is the content confidential? The answer is undoubtedly yes, since most if not all of his involves colluding with Russia and covering up Trump’s and his administration’s crimes, past and present.  Of course Trump and Gang of Liars know this; it’s just more smoke in his idiot followers tiny little eyes.
eng_test_4159	Sounds like what yoiu really need is a bus pass.
eng_test_4160	Trump supporters were all for Mueller until he assembled a team of top-notch prosecutors and they begin to realize that he is willing and able to get to the bottom of things.  Expect the attacks from the alt-right on Mueller and his team to intensify.  He's friends with Comey, they donated to democrats, blah blah blah.  Whatever.  The only real reason to fire Mueller is to try and bury the investigation.  Please Mr. President, fire Mueller, I double dog dare you.
eng_test_4161	Trump is a textbook malignant narcissist; a mental disorder. Check it out.
eng_test_4162	Eugene "elects" a progressive  (aka:socialist/liberal)  mayor? NO WAY!   It's like I have a crystal ball in predicting just how bassackwards this town can be in its liberal agenda.   @Garycrum  "...the people have spoke..."???   Blind people leading blind people (or electing) is a clear demonstration of just how uninformed and uneducated the voters are on real issues,  not to mention basic facts and statistics that prove that socialist regimes (Bernie) never work.  And ask who's a successful criminal.... to Hillary Clinton.    This town is sad and pathetic. It reminds me of a kitchen full of drone sweeper robots who's batteries are near dead from sweeping up so much garbage.
eng_test_4163	Cheap actors forget memorized lines but his problem is he ran out of fingers to help aide him.  What a goof!  Just not ready. Never will be!
eng_test_4164	Great result! Check out the video, and then remind yourself that these are kids barely out of high school.
eng_test_4165	The "kid" is 20 years old... regardless, abusing any person should never be tolerated but abusing an "at risk" person is especially disgusting and this pathetic person deserves every day in prison!

eng_test_4167	Trump will never criticize Russia unless Putin gives him the script and permission. It pretty clear by now that Putin owns a big piece of Trump. That's why we don't get to see Trump's tax returns. Who has been investing in Trump all these years and bailing him out from disastrous business decisions? Putin! Might as well hang the Russian flag on the White House flag pole!
eng_test_4168	I can eat it for breakfast. In fact, I believe it's Kelp Season now. Herring eggs on kelp freshly harvested is a wonderful Spring Tonic and tastes wicked good!
eng_test_4169	Balsillie proposed trying to market BBM as Text Messaging 2.0 hoping that it would become the next standard for texting.  This would have been awesome.  Unfortunately his colleagues could not see his vision.
eng_test_4170	Bingo.  And the answer is: virtue signalling.
eng_test_4171	If the guy had a beef against the Russian government, why did he bomb, main and kill innocent civilians in a subway car? --- The usual apologists will respond you in no time. Western presence in Middle East, The Queen pilfering India, decadent and uneducated west, etc. Yep...that works even for attacks in Russia.
eng_test_4172	They will have a hard time explaining how they needed to shoot 17 bullets at somebody running away from them and throwing rocks. What a bunch of crap!
eng_test_4173	Donald Trump twitter followers - 17.4 million Elizabeth Renzatti  twitter followers -8000 (most / all of them  in the GTA)  Elizabeth - you're an irrelevant GTA Liberal whiner.

eng_test_4175	I disagree with your opinion.
eng_test_4176	Carpa, sorry it didn't work out for you.
eng_test_4177	May the malignant narcissist and pathetically mentally warped sociopath lose it all. The disingenuous pathological liar has brought nothing but disgrace upon the presidency.
eng_test_4178	Old racist southern Democrats have as much in common with current progressives as the common-sense moderate Republicans of the 60s/70s have with Trump - that is to say, nothing. Don't buy into the 'my team/your team' garbage - it's very unflattering for all who partake.
eng_test_4179	You don't have to wonder Beav; you make a fool of yourself on a daily basis. What do you tell your family?
eng_test_4180	Thomas I thought you said it was "true EVIL" when you mom didn't buy your Nutella and pudding cups
eng_test_4181	Rant? no it's an opinion.  Yes Obama didn't deliver what the Conservatives wanted that is true. Dissatisfaction with the status quo is part of why trump got elected and not by the majority I might add.  Regarding  the comment about the status quo I was referring to present tense when I stated it. Compared to the current dysfunction of the Trump Administration, the "previous" status quo did function, not a well as some would have liked, but it did function.
eng_test_4182	Yes not one word about the mothers and farther paying their final respects to dead  children and relatives in England.today. No no its about TRUMP and any-piece of crap you can piece together to hide your failed Marxist ideology.   Truly ChuckT these people are no better than animals.
eng_test_4183	Yes, Uyesugi knew exactly who he wanted to kill.  He let one guy go, Randy S., who was respectful of him. Uyesugi felt the others were not.
eng_test_4184	Typical political BS; threaten to cut popular programs so they can get the funding they want for their pet projects.
eng_test_4185	Odd that the country that elected someone who brags about being able to grab a woman's pussy would exalt someone who objects to having that happen.

eng_test_4190	Direct Francis quotes re AL critique ...seems an incredibly obvious and simple rejection of the critique by Burke et al:  “Some people — I am thinking of certain responses to Amoris Laetitia — continue to misunderstand," Francis said. “It’s either black or white [to them], even if in the flow of life you have to discern."  Asked about critics.....Francis said, “I don’t lose sleep over it."  “As for opinions of others," he said, “we always have to distinguish the spirit in which they are given.   Other times you see right away that the critics pick bits from here and there to justify a pre-existing viewpoint;   they are not honest, they are acting in bad faith to foment divisions."

eng_test_4192	He is NOT a fraud.  Having worked with President Trump he is a very smart man.  Maybe one day you will WAKE UP and understand this.  President Trump has been in his new job for 100 days and you people are not giving him a chance to get things done.  Mr Trump loves our country and is a great family man.    The fact you and others think that Hawaii is running so great you should really FOCUS your own leaders in this state who are Incompetent and Useless.  Its incredible how much HATE comes from the so called tolerant left.
eng_test_4193	Bull!  Please list for us all suicide bombs, truck attacks, nightclub shootings et. al. which Christians have committed in the name of god.   Your silly little deflection is completely irrational and dishonest.

eng_test_4196	James Reeves 198 - Again, opinions only, and no proof of anything.  Fluoridation opponents live in an alternate reality where they believe unsupportable opinions are equivalent to facts that are supported by evidence.
eng_test_4197	What debate?   At this point the evidence is pretty darn obvious.
eng_test_4198	Big and complicated? That's just crap. First of all there are now numerous jurisdictions, including several American states, already doing it and we can copy from their work. That's not complicated.  Possession of less than a pound could be decriminalized tomorrow and should have been decriminalized a year ago. Easy. Growing fewer than 5 plants, same thing. Easy, should have been done already, could be done tomorrow, does NOT require a massive national infrastructure.   What's complicated is figuring out how to legalize it while still maintaining the incredibly profitable virtual monopoly of the majors selling through health Canada. Legalization isn't big and complicated, but building a permanent profitable industry for those private parties sure is.
eng_test_4199	see how smart canadians are!  in the 70s on yonge street homosexuals took a shoe shine kid and killed him and put him on a roof top.  maybe raped as well?  i have no prob with homosexuals but after this there was the crack down.  done son

eng_test_4204	This is b.s. She should do her research before shooting her mouth off. There are videos of Trump acting the same way while talking about other people who are not disabled. Also, you can see video of this reporter talking and he does not wave his hands like that. So Trump was not mocking his disability, his issue was with what the reporter SAID. But the media puts something like this out there and a whole lot of stupid people just buy it. Kind of scary, actually. And who cares what Meryl Streep says, anyway?
eng_test_4205	"It promises a painful fight for a better life, against America’s own elitist politicians and greedy corporations,"  "The fight will call for pragmatic actions which may, for a painful period, require ignoring good and desirable environmental and free-trade practices."  This is just what the "greedy corporations" want and are now prospering from on the stock market. Of course, when the average Joe sees his short term job from this evaporate in a cloud of pollution and safety infractions resulting is severe detriment to his health and welfare, he will then blame the so called  "elitist politicians" for failing to protect hm and continue to vote for the well funded right wing criminal trash ones.  The stupidity of the American right wing voter is limitless.

He said So was fired from his job because of the charges.   /Q  While it sucks about how he treated the dog, it also sucks that he lost his JOB because of it.   I also have neighbors with yappy-assed dogs. My dog barks only if someone is in the driveway or we're playing, or if a moose ambles in on us. It can be annoying as hell, since said dogs seem to bark at a leaf blowing past their dog dishes.

eng_test_4217	I do know that you can put out large bird replicas to keep other birds away.  I'm not sure if an owl, hawk, or eagle would keep ravens away.  Ravens are pretty smart.  I know someone that had a problem woodpecker pecking on their siding so they hoisted up a fake owl and it solved the issue.

eng_test_4231	Well. Two comments here: One. Those kids don't exist as fodder for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Two: Maybe you should have thought out the whole 'regulatory capture' thing before you let them contaminate agriculture and displace food from the store shelves with unhealthy crap. These betrayals and abdications of duty to The People have consequence, do they not? Your chickens are coming home to roost, as was always inevitable. What were you ever even thinking, you profoundly immoral corrupt psychos?
eng_test_4232	Tsk.  That's like saying Harry Potter was just a so-so kids' movie.  It's the (award-winning, best-selling, published in 38 languages) books, man, and the world they've created in millions of minds worldwide, not just the five movies (which have grossed $3.3 billion worldwide).    Our whole area benefits from Twilight tourism  --  PA and Sequim owe Forks a vote of thanks for giving devoted Twilight fans a satisfying destination to visit, because every Forks-bound fan comes through and spends money in the two more "notable" cities.
eng_test_4233	Another week another ignorant letter by Shannyn.  Is she even capable of writing an article that isn't taking the talking points of the hate-filled, racist, totalitarian miss-named Democratic Party and claiming them as her own.  She also missed the part that apparently Hillary took 20K in campaign donations from the Klu-Klux Clan and it's members.  Trump told David Duke and his followers to take a hike.
eng_test_4234	Except it wasn't walking out on the kneelers. Pence had the press standing by, his exit was part of his schedule for a fundraising event elsewhere.
eng_test_4235	Lisa always has been an idiot. Dont forget that Daddy gave her the job.
eng_test_4236	No tanaka. Talking about felons,wanted criminals,gang members that are here. Those coming in for sanction can be propery vetted. Aloha kepeni.
eng_test_4237	A fundamental policy change like this takes years of planning beforehand. By then we'll know if Trump was a sad historical footnote (he lost the popular vote after all), at which point we can go back to business as usual, or if the shift in the world order is for real, at which point we can put the plan in motion.
eng_test_4238	As you obviously know, everyone lies. I do, you do, everyone. And yes even children. The difference between Clinton and trump is Clinton like most liars is a situational liar. Trump is a pathological liar. Big difference.
eng_test_4239	If this is about getting investors to invest money in Canada and Canadians then why Mr Trudeau are they attending and paying to attend a Liberal fundraiser?  How stupid do you think Canadians are JT?
eng_test_4240	Social Security has become PERS and PERS has become Social Security.  Even the blind can hear the old Fram oil filter commercial line, "you can pay me now, or you can pay me later."  The stupid will continue to think we can pay it later.  The smart will prepare for the stupid.

Let me say this to every one of you. YOU MAKE ME SICK! Get off the public dole, you leaches, and earn an honest living for once in your life.
eng_test_4243	you are an ignorant fool Allan - stop putting foolish words around the truth - the truth is I am not respected so I am just giving it right back.  Scared has nothing to do with it dear.  Clearly your ignorance knows no bounds and it is people like you who make this into an issue when there originally wasn't one.  You don't like it, too bad  We are all entitled to our opinion and we still have a choice.  I chose not to deal with her. Plain and simple.
eng_test_4244	You should also watch John Oliver's bit on school choice. He talks about a lack of oversight regarding a number of these school choice programs pooping up around the country.
eng_test_4245	What will the corporate governance look like at Aramco?  How much say will minority investors have in the operations of the company?    Other state-controlled oil companies, like PetroBras, are not run to maximize returns to shareholders, they are run to fulfill the political and social goals of the country.  Is that what you want if you are a shareholder in Saudi Aramco?  I doubt it - so stay away from this, unless you want to short it vs. other oil companies that are truly run like businesses.  Either that or it should trade at a huge discount to its peers.
eng_test_4246	I think that it is "insanely funny" that the Germans would continue to open their borders to more Islamic radical terrorists.  Let them do what they choose to do and let them suffer the consequences by themselves.  Does she think the US is going to help in any way when the dodo hits the fan?  I hope not!  People do crazy things and think nothing about what negative things can take place, I say too bad so sad, but their call, not ours.  In maybe a decade from now, there will be more Muslims in Germany than true Germanic people, how's that for being nice to them, huh????  CRAZY!!!!
eng_test_4247	Only a total crook would do what these scumbag Libs are planning.

eng_test_4249	Truly, summers off, indexed pensions and six figures and they need MORE!!!  How about somebody puts a leash on the unions and start respecting the tax payers, the largest sub sovereign debt in the world at a bill a month to finance is NO laughing matter.
eng_test_4250	Oh I think that is just childish pouting put to words.  Eugene rider, there are idiots everywhere.  It's how we handle them that matters.  I seriously..........highly doubt that EPD only tickets those they know will pay.  Eventually, those homeless will be jailed or kicked out of Eugene if too many tix's stack up.
eng_test_4251	Can't wait! Thanks to Michelle B. and Summer Sessions for making this event happen.
eng_test_4252	These meetings tend to attract cranks with time on their hands who do not represent community viewpoints. In fact, most local residents have only one serious regret about these projects, namely, that a building is not being built on the northwest-corner, a drug and crime hangout that plagues the neighbourhood.  Toronto must not listen to the cranks or cut back on these developments. The future will need different legal structures than these, but citizens have yet to wake up to these much better possibilities. But most everyone agrees right now that the future will need these buildings and many more like them.

eng_test_4254	Time will tell. But I note that for all the resources Trump could throw at his companies' bankruptcies in the past, he has vastly greater resources to counter your personal fantasy about his impeachment today.  There's nothing Trump has done SO FAR that justifies an impeachment. Not constitutionally, and certainly not politically. Trump is your nightmare; impeachment isn't his.
eng_test_4255	"Slam opponents"...Confederate Flag" ..... LOL
eng_test_4256	you are very ignorant of the facts of history
eng_test_4257	I hope you're right, and I hope you're wrong.  Right because the US will be rid of an unstable, egotistical sociopath.  Wrong because Pence is on a mission to take the country back to the 1950s.
eng_test_4258	Well we have a 45 that is a moron in the highest office in the USA. Sad, biggly.
eng_test_4259	Their profit took a hit last year when they wrote off expenses re Keystone when Obama stopped it.   Those costs will be reversed if they restart the process.  Learn how to read an income statement instead of a stock page on G&M.
eng_test_4260	That's not racism.  That's stupidity.  You have a false narrative as well as a false definition of racism.  Also, Trump proved his racism yet again today.  He called the Mayor of San Juan a poor leader as she waded through flood waters, and he went golfing.  That is called white privilege.
eng_test_4261	The Spirit of God says, "The news media, the news media, you have become a stench unto my nostrils, there is no spirit of truth in you.  I the Lord God will clean out the news media and bring back truth.  The sign will be given when news outlets will go down, bankrupt, and I the Lord God will rebuild them using my righteous people to restore them.  I am calling on my Army, those who are chosen to be journalists, investors, to get ready to take your place as I tear down and rebuild my news media."  The Spirit of God says, "Where are my billionaires and millionaires?  Why are you not buying out these news outlets and taking control?  That money I gave you was for my kingdom, to advance my kingdom in all areas of influence.  Now is the time to move into my news media!

Your aim is not to share a different opinion or point of view based on fact, you're spreading mean spirited lies and rumors designed to satisfy some internal urge of yours to bring down this great country of ours. I'd ask if you care about this country or have any shame, but what's the point? If you did you wouldn't be posting your prejudice and poison to begin with.

eng_test_4271	Lol, the Rs are about to "fix" healthcare with a bill that doesn't cut costs and doesn't cover "everybody". What's left will be cheaper plans that cover less and provide no incentives to make our system more efficient. The "Market" system we had before ACA didn't even come close to providing better outcomes at lower costs compared to other nationalized systems. But hey, our hospitals have pretty marble lobby's and plush waiting rooms. For profit healthcare is awesome!

We know Dr. Marrus holds no racist ideas, and to imply that his comment is racist and out of line is ridiculous.   As to the students' behaviour over at U of T, what can one say.  They are fretful and banal.  I wish there were som counter action against this thin skinned crowd.
eng_test_4284	Outline is correct.  Not a word about how, if he were to deliver it all, it would DECREASE revenue by 9.6 trillion dollars over ten years, increasing the deficit.

eng_test_4308	Residents of Palmer, Wasilla, and Houston should not be allowed to vote on the borough ban.  I live outside of city limits,  therefore I was not allowed to take part in their city elections.  As it stands, those living within city limits who already voted "no" once, will be allowed to vote again to determine what happens to those of us that live outside of city limits. In other words, their vote gets counted twice.  If I am not allowed to determine policy within the incorporated areas of the borough, those that live in incorporated areas should not be allowed to determine policy for those of us that choose to live outside of city limits.

eng_test_4310	You have sources? Next let me do some basic math. 60% have proven they will add, how? Low paying, low taxable income jobs is a benefit. Surely not all 60% are doctors, etc. So let's be generous and say 15-20% are net positive that leaves 30-35%  that won't be. Those with children will receive Universal child tax benefit for free. Net loss. Then you have 20% sponsored. These sponsors will cover assistance for 12 months and after that the contract is done and welfare can begin. Any rogue sponsored immigrant who leaves prior to that year can go on welfare but will have to be repaid by the sponsor as per high court ruling. The majority of these immigrants  will be on welfare and you can cite my source from previous posts that I'm sure are still unread. Once again a net loss. Then I'm assuming the last 20% you conveniently left out are simply unsponsored economic migrants which no doubt is a massive net loss.  Once again please cite any credible government sources you have.

eng_test_4319	Golly none? In the past 5 years alone, the GTN pipeline you claim as a flawless example has had three incidents, totaling over $1.14 million in property damage and an value of ~$380k in product spilled: https://goo.gl/LgZ3ao  Using the highest industrial price of $5.62 per mill Btu during those five years, $380k = 67,616,000,000 Btu. There are ~102,000 Btu per 1 Ccf, and 1 Ccf is about 748 U.S. liquid gallons. That $380k was roughly 495,885,135 gallons of spilled product. Care yet?   The operator information there doesn't even include "all" incidents, as operators are only required (under 49 CFR 191)  to report incidents that involve death or serious injury, property damage of $50k or more, a gas loss of $50k or more, and/or an unestimated gas loss of 3 million Ccf or more. Maybe if this "small" leak happened on your property you'd care? https://goo.gl/UJ3XKw   FUN FACT: Still counts as a disaster/having a negative environmental impacts, even if you don't think it affects you.

eng_test_4321	at this point, referring to it as a transportation "system" is a stretch.  it would all have to work somewhat cohesively in the1st place to be defined as a system.  so much money, a built in, should- be supportive community base, a long time, well connected Washington politician/benefactor who chairs transportation, one of the most powerful congressional committees  channeling money into the LTD pipeline for years.  -  so much has been squandered.  so much wasted.  so many failed experiments.  LTD and their "innovative, outside the box "approach is for research and development on paper and in models....not multi million dollar buses that get scrapped in a few years because they just plain didn't stay running. ( it DID save gas - yes it did.! ) millions to develop, no less,  a radio system that is so confusing that drivers sitting at tables, training on it, can't figure it out.  2 or 3 years later it's scrapped. there wasn't an existing, suitable PROVEN effective system to model after?

eng_test_4334	Obamacare was a stepping stone to socialized medicine, everyone knew that. But all the subsidies are difficult to take away in one fell swoop. Until people get better wages they're trapped by the cost of health care. Unless you want everyone in the ER you will need to subsidize low income and pre existing folks.  As Perot said, "when people have good paying jobs a lot of social problems go away". Thats true. The economy is picking up and wages are starting to rise. That will help. Separating the pre existing conditions folks out of the mainstream insurance market will bring down rates some.  But the Rand Pauls of the world seem to think you can just make it all free market in one fell swoop. Thats political suicide. , it will take time. Trying to read that monstrosity will give you a headache.  But we do need to move back to a competition model. I have never heard a logical justification for not selling insurance across state lines, negotiating drug prices, or tort reform.
eng_test_4335	This is ridiculous, hiding Hilary behind her sex. I will attack anyone who has done what Trump did (which I didn't need to because he got chewed out earlier), and I will attack Hillary for what she has done. I don't care if they are a girl, Muslim, black, Christian, Mexican, gay, or anything in-between; I will never withhold criticism of actions. I was pointing out the hypocrisy of the statement Trump is bad role model so we should elect Hilary. I believe Hillary is worse, you can disagree and that's ok. But both are terrible role models, and her being a woman doesn't change that.
eng_test_4336	Trump has lots to apologize for.  let me just list a couple:  1.  He has refused to release his tax returns even though all presidential candidates since Nixon has.  He promised that he would release them, then changed his mind.  This makes him a big fat liar.  2.  He promised health care second to none but instead backed a plan that was just plain crap.  Liar liar pants on fire....  3.  He promised that he would drain the swamp but instead has made it twice as big and 10 times as deep.  Already it is almost filled up with slime.  Way to drain the swamp Donald.

eng_test_4343	Oh so Trump is speaking truth because liberals cannot be trusted? HOW is that evidence for anything? Where does an assertion like that come from?  We can just make assertions now and if we just don't like the people being accused that means it's worth investing? Do you know how absurd that sounds? Whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty? We're not even to that step because no body has been found. You're just saying "There COULD be a body found. We should start investigating right away."  I know what you're going to say "Well liberals do it!" ....I don't agree when liberals do it either (like the IRS just targeting tea party groups). If anyone is willing to turn a blind eye to that kind of absurd abuse and paranoia we should always stand up to it. It is simply un-Americana to think that the government can operate on hunches and wild accusations.   Either you stand up to corruption and false accusations or you're for them. There is no double standard.

eng_test_4346	Don't blame "people of faith." The hateful zombies who blindly follow their party over common sense aren't practicing their "faith."

eng_test_4349	For those who argue that the ADN is out to smear Mr. Trump, how do you account for these endorsements by newspapers that seldom, if ever, endorse the Democratic nominee for President? It could be the Secretary Clinton is the best qualified candidate.  The Dallas Morning News: "We don't come to this decision easily. This newspaper has not recommended a Democrat for the nation's highest office since before World War II — if you're counting, that's more than 75 years and nearly 20 elections."   The Cincinnati Enquirer: "The Enquirer has supported Republicans for president for almost a century ... But this is not a traditional race, and these are not traditional times. ... We need a leader who will bring out the best in all Americans, not the worst."  The Arizona Republic: "This year is different. The 2016 Republican candidate is not conservative and he is not qualified. That's why, for the first time in our history, The Arizona Republic will support a Democrat for president.

And the NDP is going to "clean up" campaign finance - because it's not as if the NDP is beholden to a powerful and self-serving US union that supports Trump's protectionism... oh well, housing sounds good and the short-sighted idealists in Vancouver have obviously fallen for it. Meanwhile Vancouver is paralyzed by constant gridlock thanks to Moonbeam's bike lanes. But Horgan is going to invest in "climate change" aka high taxes and McGuinty/Wynne-inspired social experiments that amount to an exercise in government incompetence under the guise of being "sustainable". BC doesn't need resources, they need more bike co-ops and rooftop spinach farms... the low carbon future... like Cuba...

And your pitiful challenge with wanting to kick my a_s, typical of your thug attitude.  You've  called me several rotten a_s names I don't deserve, but a little man's behavior and attitude makes you violent!?   Can dish it out you pathetic, so-called man of many experiences, but man when someone best's you with knowledge & experience then you show just how ignorant and arrogant you are, then it's time to bloody the water.  You've learned well from "some" of those in the hood, killer!!  There now, does that show respect??  Which from those "like" you is never, ever earned but demanded & taken!!
eng_test_4394	Naturally, you have reliable contacts inside of all of those intelligence agencies that keep you informed of their (lack of) progress, so you KNOW they have "not a single shred of evidence".
eng_test_4395	Since multiple versions of the $10 bill are in circulation at any given time we in effect will have exactly that
eng_test_4396	Pretty sure trump hates America, because it wasn't his idea.  The bedrock of our great nation and it's still great no matter what trump and his supporters say for their own benefit, is the legitimacy of the presidential vote. I don't care what your politics are you don't start down the path of rejecting that.   He has no idea what he's doing, he has no idea of the potential consequences of such talk and he doesn't care because it's all about his paper thin ego. This is proof enough he has no business being president.  Hillary is everything you expect from a career politician, a real shady a**hole, but that can't legitimize voting for someone who is both so ignorant and so callous as to threaten the continuation of our democracy because he's got a tiny penis
eng_test_4397	The investigation should continue. Call in other investigators if the current ones cant figure it out. The facts are not all in and some could be lying.
eng_test_4398	You mean potty trained.  Sorry, I couldn't resist.
eng_test_4399	ValleyIsle57>  Just my  point of view from where I sit and listen to all of your punk ass excuses, have you any guts or are you a coward???  I am for one thing not sick and maybe a little scary at times, but you fail to see anything beyond your tiny safe haven.  Grow up and look around.  Do you care if any of the other countries condemn or condone what we do???  They could give a rat's ass, as to what will happen to the US in this situation.  Don't you know that the world basically hates the USA, and it isn't because of Trump, they've hated us for years and years.  I don't need any help nor seek any help, but you my cowardly friend, needs to go suck on your thumb and dream of all your phony love relationships with the rest of the world.  You are a fool.  Absolute FOOL.  Have a nice day.
eng_test_4400	As the saying goes, anyone who lies openly and brazenly to your face thinks you're weak or stupid. And if you believe them, you are.
eng_test_4401	Walker is a crook.  Guess who's only a one termer.
eng_test_4402	It is easier for an engineer in BC to work off shore than in another province. Why?  Why can't a doctor certified in Ontario work in Manitoba without seeking approval from Manitoba?
eng_test_4403	your post just plain stupid as usual!
eng_test_4404	Like a toddler, Trump lacks any self-control. He never grew up, never developed integrity, and utterly lacks leadership ability.  No wonder the world is laughing at him and the US. What kind of country elects such a mentally-disturbed, ignorant fool? Hint. It's not a great one.
eng_test_4405	It's not unrelated at all when her husband is a bully, and she says nothing about it.
eng_test_4406	This loathsome little man just gets more and more vile.  How does he manage it?  Being only twelve years old, completely self-obsessed, a compulsive liar, and a jerk.  To the extent that there is an upside, it is that it is his idiot supporters who he will screw the worst; serves them right.
eng_test_4407	Rino exposed.
eng_test_4408	oh save the stupidity pal, trump is an elected leader period, he has the congress to work with as well, they hold the power in the end, ,, you can yap all you want but try to get educated into reality first
eng_test_4409	You're basing your accusation on lip reading of a covertly filmed and dishonestly edited partisan video?  Do you read lips?  As nearly as I can tell, you can't even read reasonably written posts.  Your accusation is 100% dishonest.  You yourself, and your family, no doubt have benefitted medically from fetal tissue research.  You are a hypocrite.
eng_test_4410	No - you are NOT right. Debate about abortion is fine when it is rational and compassionate. Under those terms solutions may actually be found. Our societal problems do need to be addressed and discussed, but what you and other "holier than thou"  one-issue obsessed Catholics do concerning abortion is not argument- it is bullying and demonizing the pathetic women who find themselves in a crisis situation.  It's not Christian behavior towards those we need to have compassion for. There is no "pro-abortion" stance. No woman could possibly want to have an abortion!  As soon as your nasty inflammatory language comes out - you lose any pretense of rational debate. You just end up looking like sadistic, sexist, insecure, schoolyard bullies.
eng_test_4411	CFL players are commenting because Sebastian Giovinco is a whining wimp. Simple as that.
eng_test_4412	Hillary, your supporters are either ignorant or evil like you.
eng_test_4413	Kilmer, I'm a veteran and you don't speak for me, dummy.
eng_test_4414	He's right.  She's crazier than Hooter Brown, but one hell of leader & politician.
eng_test_4415	We will be stripping CA of every taxpayer dime.  And emptying  their state of illegals leaving them with a lot more to cry about than Trump.
eng_test_4416	Are you SERIOUS????  You're insane. The Broncos have proved, time after time, that DRAFT STATUS MEANS NOTHING. Especially after Elway took over. Ask Chris Harris, CJ Anderson...and oh yeah...7TH ROUNDER Trevor Siemian.  Elway's ego? He's the one who brought in Sloter!  This is such a stupid comment. Good luck to Sloter though.  As for draft efficiency...I'll agree on the offensive side. On defense? Elway is still a genius.
eng_test_4417	Typical DemoRat. Instead of addressing the issue, our governor thwarting OUR President, and the will of the people, you jump on petty crap, and cite that as proof that your side is so much more intelligent that the patriots. Pretty pathetic, putz.
eng_test_4418	Finally something we all -- left, right, and center-- can agree on: This guy is an absolute scumbag.
eng_test_4419	Not custom made. Cheap, unoriginal, piece of shit on ebay.
eng_test_4420	Well played!    This 27 year old rapist clearly was not interested in sex!
eng_test_4421	Still lookin' good Don!
eng_test_4422	This is mueller pasta's way of getting Manafort to say anything to help himself and lie to make President Trump look bad.  mueller will have to come up with some stupid thing to justify his existence and all the money he is giving to his clinton pal lawyers.
eng_test_4423	You are a nasty little bugger eh, so how much corporate fraud are you involved in?
eng_test_4424	Doing that kind of crap helps absolutely no one. When it does really happen, people will shrug their shoulders and assume it's BS.
eng_test_4425	It's infrastructure.  We can't afford not to build it.  Cheers -
eng_test_4426	His handlers obviously pulled his ears and made him call out the klan and white supremacists "and other hate groups". The man is an inept moron.
eng_test_4427	You can't fix stupid.  Tell her you will be there if/when she wakes up, otherwise, don't hang around them.  There are other people to talk to at most gatherings where you will be attending together.  Just be up front with her, then move on.  She shouldn't need to "confide" in anyone if she needs help.  She knows what she needs to do.  Dump him and move on.  Anything else is just drama and gossip.
eng_test_4428	When Liberals like you get in touch with your "inner child",..it is lauded!....LOL....no one called a man-baby.....hypocrites.
eng_test_4429	You want a pie in your hole and your a$$ kicked? LOL
eng_test_4430	Kneeling in the ThugFL started with a desire by one demographic desiring to see more dead cops. This is what the ThugFL stands (kneels) for—Pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon.
eng_test_4431	How many kids has the POPE abused?  The POPE is DIRTY as well.....................
eng_test_4432	A vast collection of washing machines.
eng_test_4433	He would rather support a corrupt politician than anyone else.  Party before country? The Democrats are pathetic!
eng_test_4434	Ken W :  Please tell that to the Korean store owners and other homeowners who fought off  violent looters and rioters during the L.A. Riots.   I was there. Were You?
eng_test_4435	Why? Look at the Trudeau Cabinet. How many individuals in cabinet that have experience related to their position? How many are competent? How many have made a difference, for the better, in the past two years. Trudeau has spent $30 billion dollars and the only one to have benefited is Omar Khadar and  Rana Sarkar.
eng_test_4436	I now see what you mean. Well thank the gods for these liberals like Phil Barnhart to protect us dumb yokels from being influenced by "rich outsiders" and our own bad decisions.
eng_test_4437	Anything to fill a few lines around the ads.
eng_test_4438	Such an effective way to generate peace.  Trying to show who is the biggest jerk around.  Pretty pathetic.  Come on America stop playing war games off the Korean coast.
eng_test_4439	This is why we need gun laws, or at least A gun law. Too many kids are getting guns easily and committing crimes. If you are going to own a gun you should be required to take a fucking test like you do to drive a car! And have gun insurance!
eng_test_4440	I'm shocked, shocked! to find firefighters wear belts with their suspenders.
eng_test_4441	Wrong, of course some people got insurance but no where near the numbers promised and 84 % of those were simply gifted into an already overburdened medicaid. And while they have the card new studies show the uninsured have better outcomes than those on medicaid as doctor flee from the regulations and stop accepting patients. While this was happening millions lost their coverage as insurers dropped out of markets and those seeking employment found only part time jobs that allowed employers to avoid providing costly insurance. More lost coverage when small business were forced out of business or had to downsize. The next time government publishes honest number will be the first time, they have proven themselves unreliable. All this is really a distraction from the fact that the end game for democrat's is a socialist 1 payer system which the majority do not want. As we've already seen socialist programs cost more, provide less and take away free choice. It's also unconstitutional .
eng_test_4442	This woman is irrelevant.
eng_test_4443	Thanks for your efforts and the work of the Denali Citizens Council, Nancy.  I've always found you to be a good communicator.  There won't be any constructive dialogue on this issue as long as the BOG holds all the power and calls dissenters "emotional."
eng_test_4444	Again, same idiot wants to be the judge of what is "idiotic."  Now that's rich...
eng_test_4445	Why are we not surprised at the response from Trump suckees. They're as mentally deficient as their hero.
eng_test_4446	Ms Wynne has clearly thrown in the towel on her real responsibility, which is to foster an environment in which employers can create jobs, or in which people can become self-employed, so that people can work and support themselves. Instead of that, all she can think of is to hand out our hard-earned money on the street corner to anyone who doesn't happen to want to work - and there are plenty of those. If you've hit some bad luck, then social assistance should be available for a while to help you get back on your feet; but a lifetime of living off my earnings - I don't think so. This stupid stupid, stupid, program will be killed off by popular resentment from taxpayers and millions of dollars will, in the meantime, be thrown away. Why can't she see that?
eng_test_4447	Are you a pervert, Rough cut, looking between people's legs?
eng_test_4448	Refusing medications and then tranquilizing them could constitute manslaughter.  How many more people have died the same way and not just at that facility.
eng_test_4449	Yeah it's a great conspiracy to make white people ,fat ,dumb and lazy.  It's working!
eng_test_4450	Racism is your forked tongue....
eng_test_4451	Hardly, esp if he's got Ben Carson and Rick Perry in the lineup. What a pair of idiots those two are.
eng_test_4452	Are you kidding me? You people are braindead idiots.   NO!!!  FIX THE SPENDING PROBLEM FIRST.
eng_test_4453	Why is it not attempted murder? This is nothing. And I think they should water bord to get that teen to talk of the others that was with him!! Wtf!!! So tired of these young kids these days. No morals, no respect, no punishment!! Hell I was arrested at 19 for telling s black cop he was being racist. Thrown into jail one night and stood in front of a judge who handed me my punishment and said. If I did not do it I would be arrested again and would be put in jail for 3 to 6 months. And that was just saying something to s cop. It's bull shit how things are now. Granted I never went back to Jail , never been arrested since then. I learn my lesson .
eng_test_4454	This law does nothing except reduce accountability and increase crime. This is not a cost saving measure. Those who support SB91 were duped by a heavily funded outsider organization. Sad!
eng_test_4455	I have had my car broken into 4 times by these scum bags taking nothing more than a dollar in change, if that.  Costing me hundreds to fix.  I am happy every time I hear that one of these parasites has overdosed.  One down, many more to go.
eng_test_4456	How can anyone defend a draft dodging coward?
eng_test_4457	I just endured listening to Carol Off on the CBC's As It Happens soft pitch our environment minister on the Paris treaty, insisting on contrasting the Liberals with the Harper government's take on agreement. Not once did she mention that the Liberals have essentially adopted the Conservatives climate change targets. As a reminder this means that the EU and US (until today) plan to reduce their emissions by about 2.8%/year between 2020-30. Canada will achieve 1.7%/year.  It was a typically tedious piece of biased and cloying journalism dressed up with the smug leading assumptions of Ms. Off's politics. I am no fan of the Cons approach to the issue but expect more than a partisan info-mercial from our taxpayer funded broadcaster. I would rather have heard more about the fact Paris sets no binding targets for reducing global GHG emissions and no timelines, deadlines or penalties for failure to comply. But I suppose that would have been an "inconvenient truth".
eng_test_4458	Oh, so the idiots who run the Sierra Club (and their supporters) don’t benefit from security lighting that dampens all crime in their cities.  They must think night lighting comes from pixie dust.  Perry should also suggest young women in Third World Nations and Islamic controlled countries be issued a pink 38 caliber pistol.  Armed blacks using their second amendment rights ended the reign of terror they faced from the KKK.  It will work for oppressed women too.  What do you think, Libs?
eng_test_4459	We might as well call him president elect Forrest Trump, "stupid is as stupid does".
eng_test_4460	Check your privilege.  Why do you automatically assume the women selected are less meritous than men (especially white men)?  Just because a bunch of white guys weren't chosen for every job in sight, you cry discrimination.  What a hypocrite.
eng_test_4461	A park my kids love burning to the ground is "glorious news?"  I don't know if you're a troll or what, but that is just wrong.
eng_test_4462	Now Agent Orange Tees up Venezuela too, what a dangerous ignorant clown.   6 months in and he's in a nuclear standoff, wonder why it took so long.
eng_test_4463	What if she's wrong?  Isn't that what they always say?  What if you deniers are wrong?  Can we really risk the climate on you deniers?  But what if she's wrong?  After we shut down our timber.  After we should down export of coal, oil and alcohol.  After we shut down our farms.  After we tear down our dams.  And those green jobs just aren't there because it don't work.  Or the business model fails.  Or the technology is too expensive.  Or it doesn't scale up like she claims.  Then where are the rural counties?  Lost and depopulated while King County thrives and continues to thrive.  But isn't that who elected her.
eng_test_4464	Well, a black law professor got elected president.  Now we've "elected" a white ignoramus.  I'm not sure what that tells us.  Discuss.
eng_test_4465	perhaps jealous losers like you should mind your own dam business and stop crying about things that are meaningless and focus on your own lives
eng_test_4466	Damn!  Too bad that there no laypeople who can handle a job in a group allegedly devoted to Laity, Family and Life!  At first I thought this might be a spoof on the Onion.
eng_test_4467	I'm less interested in politicians missing photo ops, and more interested in details and facts of the emerging story behind the Grenfell fire.
eng_test_4468	Only an idiot needs a village
eng_test_4469	or maybe it was just an *&^% with a gun being really stupid? criminally stupid?!   if one of the guys from the tree service had pulled out his own gun in response and shot and killed him it would have been 100% justified.  if i turn my house into a meth lab while flying an American flag, will i have your support?  your comment is incredibly disturbing. i hope somebody keeps an eye on you!
eng_test_4470	Conservatives well-respected by academia, you mean?  They're not. Because academia is a 90% liberal domain that closes ranks. That's the whole point.
eng_test_4471	Black lives matter!!  ??
eng_test_4472	True.  That was part of Alton Baker!
eng_test_4473	Wonderful.   aloha, goodbye and go back to your black hole, you'll be smiling much more there.
eng_test_4474	all you illegal criminals, very soon you will be going to the bus station. turn in forged green card, drivers license and social security card. bye! enjoy living in the garbage dump (mexico).
eng_test_4475	Brain dead, cowards.
eng_test_4476	I viewed this carefully. The incumbent Repubs and those Repubs that want in won't answer any questions....So, because they obviously think we don't need to know anything they shouldn't get any votes. Vote for those who are bold enough to step up and answer the questions. At least you know they stand for something. Disgusting. Sullivan-Leonard, Stuttes, Stevens, Coghill  and on and on...just disgusting.
eng_test_4477	We are truly lucky that this concept of " Migrant Education " denial as structure of our nation's constitution was not even conceived  let alone debated during the creation of such a document.   Keep them barefoot,  pregnant,  and ignorant while enjoying the fruits of their back backing labor at below market value cost if a more educated population were in the fields would have demanded.   Apple a day & eat your veggies !   Proud Americans are we?
eng_test_4478	I do not share your hope that the city officials will develop a measured approach.  They are more likely to employ a bludgeon than a scalpel.
eng_test_4479	Insurance companies are NOT losing billions. What they are losing is "potential profits" because of Obamacare. If what you say was true, every stock broker would tell you you are lying or a fool. Since the collapse of oil, Medical Insurance Stocks are the #1 most profitable investment product. Recently an Ins Co CEO got a bonus for 2015 of $20,000,000 on top of his $3,000,000 salary package. As a former COO, I can tell you that no company on this planet pays a $20 mil bonus if they're losing money.  You must think your readers are stupid or totally naive. Trust me we are neither, which makes you a bald faced LIAR!!!
eng_test_4480	Or we could get rid of humans. That would save the beach for future generations....oh crap, there wouldn't be any future generations.
eng_test_4481	Richard is shamelessly blinded by anti-Israel bias, just as much as the UN. Israel is a beacon of stability surrounded by chaos, violence, and anarchy. The UN is a joke, just look at Russia and the Sakhalins, Tibet, Crimea, the South China Sea but you pick on Israel for defending itself against aggressors. "We tried to destroy you but we lost, can we please have our land back?" Of course we can't talk about Jordan or how other Arab states treat Palestinians, it's all Israel's fault - you reek of unapologetic leftwing ignorance, you have no credibility and represent the outspoken leftwing fringe of useful idiots who turn a blind eye to Hamas terrorists and their Islamist supporters - pathetic.
eng_test_4482	Mrs.WENTE tou are much tooyoung to write on this subject. Please wait a few years and have a really deep experience.
eng_test_4483	"Later the same day, McCain votes yes with his party." He voted to have a debate on possible solutions across the floor. Your quote has zero relevance.
eng_test_4484	The UN, what a pathetic joke,  Their "human rights" council is the worst of all.   But Justin loves it!
eng_test_4485	Awwwwww....did someone hurt widdle Putrumpski's feewings by tweeting the truth?   What a joke of a man. Pathetic.
eng_test_4486	yeah definitely racist,  and white supremacist and islamaphobe and sexist and  gay bashing...
eng_test_4487	Trump cannot help himself.  Blasting the mayor of San Juan shows just how stupid he his.  Let's hope that when he gets to Puerto Rico on Tuesdsay that the population pelt him with garbage and force him out.  Even better they just ask him to stay away as he is of no use to their recovery.
eng_test_4488	Alaska's social programs are out of control.  The state is insolvent and you wonder why?  If you want to live a basic, remote, subsistence lifestyle, there must be sacrifices, and the rest of the state should not have to foot the bill.  Doesn't matter if you're Native or not.  Greenland figured it out nearly 50 years ago and moved all of the social services and subsidies into the cities.  Some people chose to continue their subsistence lifestyle.  Others opted to spend their winters in the city and their summers in the bush, when the conditions aren't nearly so harsh.  Their children receive wonderful educations and everyone has access to affordable health care.
eng_test_4489	He is a liar, and not even a good one, except for the FACT that around 50% of Americans are buying his act...sheesh.
eng_test_4490	No one has respect for the "First Welfare Nations" and no amount of rewriting history and hiding the facts is going to change that, lets not forget Teresa Spence and that gong show and even the idiot left who pander do not. There was nothing wrong with full disclosure of all public funds.
eng_test_4491	The opportunists who thought they could  cash out after govt announcement and buy back cheaper later are coming to their senses quickly. Market timing is not so easy. So inventory of detached houses is already down to half, pretty soon it will be next to nothing and we start all over again.  Very very few in Toronto (a city in full expansion) need to sell and the small rate increase won't change that.
eng_test_4492	Throw him in jail.  One big scam.
eng_test_4493	Dream on Corbeil.  That's the past. Why should Dems  exercise restraint now or in the future? The GOP never has. The past 8 years and McConnell's use of the nuclear option prove that. There are very few Dems and certainly no liberals who are willing to give the GOP a pass on anything, ever again. Just like the GOP.
eng_test_4494	Trump is a vulture. I guess that makes Trudeau roadkill
eng_test_4495	Ralph likes to tell everyone how to live. He is a good little Liberal Fascist.
eng_test_4496	Where did I say that? I was attempting to define how Trump got elected. I didn't say it was a good outcome. (And no, I don't believe reigning politicians have governed effectively, or we wouldn't have Trump making things worse.)
eng_test_4497	"This leaves behind a lot of damage," he told CNS. "But we hope for goodwill ... the worries and necessities are great ... but we can learn a lot from these experiences, that we have to find the good among the bad. In the middle of all of this, faith strengthens us."cis of Assisisaid,   As Francis of Assisi admonished his family from his deathbed, "Let us  begin, for until now we have done little."
eng_test_4498	More hysterical racist nonsense.
eng_test_4499	Your arrogance fails to impress, and your baseless accusations reveal some hidden harbored animus. You can wave your hands around and try your Jedi mind tricks all you like, but it seems you're not competent.
eng_test_4500	wow the stupidity in this article is only matched by the retarded comments here... obviously the reason you people read this trash is for the comfirmation bias... enjoy your fake reality dumbshits
eng_test_4501	you believe that because absurd because you are profoundly ignorant. Liberal no growth advocates will not allow affordable housing to be built. Today affordable housing is defined by liberals as Section8, subsidized housing, where no one gets ahead. Your ignorance is profound. Right now we could be building affordable starter homes that can be purchased earning the federal minimum wage, but liberalism, a social cancer, demonizes this housing as "urban sprawl" and will not allow it to be built. It is out of your ignorance of these facts you claim I am incorrect and absurd.
eng_test_4502	The tick on the U.S.'s back enlarges....  Dump that trash.
eng_test_4503	I'm looking forward to the NDP being reduced to only one seat next time around. - spending to buy votes and still lose the election that must really hurt

eng_test_4505	A middle-aged woman jealous of a 14-year-old girl...lady, you sound to be your niece’s age. This is truly the most pathetic Letter I’ve seen in awhile.
eng_test_4506	Good job but isn't it funny that things like this get over shadowed by those stupid shows of the out of state clowns making silly sitcoms on life in Alaska.
eng_test_4507	Every  additional highrise ruins our lives more: Elephant in the room: Darn Traffic, darn waiting  in lines everywhere.
eng_test_4508	Thank you, Shirley. You gave me two roses yesterday as I got off the bus. One is sitting on my desk at work and I gave the other to a young man who was on his way to LCC (he wanted to give the rose to his girlfriend). He talked to me for about 5 minutes and it was just a nice way to start my work day. I tend to put my head down and not make eye contact with anyone downtown while making my daily trudge from the downtown station to my office and back....it was nice to have a break from the feeling I usually have the instant I set foot downtown.
eng_test_4509	This incident and its reporting are leaving me with more questions than ansewrs. Unless I missed something, there is no mention of when the tests were run. It appears it was in Nome after the race, but how long after? This article states "high levels" of the drug were found (and high  is not defined). If so, was the drug administered just before the test (and after the race), or was it administered earlier in a very high dose to begin with? In the first case it would not have affected the dogs' performance, and in the second it would multiply the chance and severity of side effects (which don't seem to have appeared).  In any case I'm not sure Tramadol would be anyone's first choice for a "perfomance enhancing" drug, and drugs, KNOWING the dogs will be tested?
eng_test_4510	I find it comical that the left wants to portray themselves as the beacons of truth and morality when they themselves and their parrots in the media gave Obama 8 years of free passes on a daily basis. Remember like a month ago when Obama banned Cuban refugees from settling here? Where were the protests and outrage. You're the pot calling the kettle black. The daily echo chamber of liberal hysteria is undermining any potentially legitimate dissent or questions about the White House's handling of anything. EVERYTHING has been made out to be an outrage since Jan 20 so the hysteria will make nothing an outrage even if it should be (not that I've seen anything at that level). Ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?! The establishment liberal press is screaming wolf from sun up to sun down and is undermining their own intentions since the public has zero faith in them save the liberals who are locked in their echo chamber
eng_test_4511	Instead of proving Barry Soweto's lie, in one or two sentences, the MSM double contorts to "soften the blow".    Typical propaganda from the Jeff Bezos (net worth $59B) owned Washington Plutocrat.
eng_test_4512	There's a difference in "unfortunate" versus not giving a crap. And the ones who are unfortunate are the distinct minority.
eng_test_4513	Jim and ALL others  on this thread:  GOD made the intestines and  Anus area for 1 reason and 1 reason only.   And that is to EXCRETE Waste(Poo) from the body.  I like GBA'S reference of Intestinal Intercourse and those that have Intercourse in the Butt should get FATAL Diseases and die.  I personally find the Wet, Hot Vagina  area the Creme de le Creme.
eng_test_4514	Making donations public is the right thing to do. It sounds sensational and groundbreaking but in reality after the initial searching for peoples' names it gets old fast. By election time this website will be the least used website in politics.
eng_test_4515	As long as people are judging this young man in the court of public opinion, I feel I might chime in on how ignorant two of these post's PERSONAL views, on a complicated social issue threatening our society, really are. First of all there is a presumption of innocence in a court of law before any evidence is presented to the jury. I assume it's to limit the amount of innocent people punished for crimes they didn't commit. To state your opinion of guilt after seeing a few sentences in an article, shows how ignorant you are of the rule of law. What if the police had questioned the wrong drunken idiot? And secondly, if the poster who thinks that tougher laws and harsher penalties is going to stop people from taking mind and mood altering substances, then you are deluded. you should go back to sleep and keep dreaming of your squeaky clean sandbox world where everyone conforms to your idea of society.   people have been taking drugs for two thousand years and will continue to regardless.
eng_test_4516	Falling back on that tired Russian collusion bullshit again, are we?  If there was, proof would have been found by now!  Simple fact is, there won't be any proof found because it never happened.  IT's just the same tired old crybaby Democratic sniffling because they lost the election FAIRLY, unlike how Clinton won the nomination, and crying because they're do-no-wrong princess Hillary didn't get into office.  Haven't we had enough of Democratic leadership, with how Obama was systematically destroying America from within, during his two terms?
eng_test_4517	"Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large numbers." You are absolutely correct! Just look at who is in charge in Canada, in Ontario, etc.
eng_test_4518	Well, let's all be clear here - Ms. Williamson's comments don't have anything to do with the Complaint. Saying "she's a bitch" is not a defense to sexual harassment, and if that's the best the company can come up with, I'm pretty sure the allegations are truthful. Shit man, they didn't even have the balls to call her a bitch using their own name, they had to make Williamson do their dirty work for them.   In any case, Hobbs is an owner and founder of the company, which means, bitch or not (and really, aren't we all bitches when we complain about our bosses?), they can't take her business away from her. Fire her? Maybe. Refuse her equity in her own business? Nope.

eng_test_4524	Cute idea. But I have a better one:  Small homogeneous nations make awesome social democracies.  Scotland and Quebec should unite and form their own egalitarian social democratic nation.     That bold progressive innovation could change the world.   Free university for everybody, five weeks vacation for everybody, five weeks of maternity leave, five weeks of paternity leave...genuine equality, low unemployment rate, low crime rate,.. Poutine basted in a groovy gravy of scotch whiskey...   And  best of all, future generations of French Scots and Scottish French will be a hoot for the entire world to enjoy. Imagine what a joy they'll all be speaking French with a Scottish accent and English with a French-Scottish accent.

eng_test_4530	If the D's and the R's cannot reach a grand compromise this year, we will further draw down our reserves, reducing our opportunity to pull out of this downturn. More taxes will impede our growth. We have to reduce spending asap. The Governor in a very brave move vetoed 1/2 the dividend last year. I agree with his promise to veto at least 1/2 again.
eng_test_4531	The article is correct.  In BC, you can make a left turn on a red light onto a one-way street independent of whether the street you are on is one-way or two-way (BC Motor Vehicle Act, 129(4)(b)).  If you think about it, you are not crossing a line of traffic doing this, since that traffic also has a red light.  You can argue it's a bad rule (what if you try to make a left turn at the same time as a car going in the opposite direction tries to make a right turn into the same lane).  But it is the law.

Millions and millions of federal dollars thrown in to allow Quebec's voters and its "elite" to think that the province can do things all on its own. Both the Pierre Trudeau Liberal government and the Mulroney Tory government "helped" Bombardier for years because it was in "la belle province" - where both men grew up. The company Bombardier would've died a long, long time ago if "profit" had been a priority (as it should be).

eng_test_4543	Singling out the great Sir John A. misses the point that he was only one over the centuries involved in the white colonization of Canada. If we follow the ETOF logic to its rational conclusion, the name of any town, building, street or park named after a white politician from the days of Champlain to the present will have to be expunged and changed.  That does not leave any names of the white colonizers to use. What is to be done then? Perhaps we should introduce a system of numbering all the changed names with a code? Would than make ETOF happy? Or maybe make them realize how silly they are?
eng_test_4544	"Canada's contribution to this effort is to show that significant progress can be made to curtail such emissions by a large, advanced and modern society without imploding its economy."   This is not some great, fun experiment for urbanites who want to feel good about themselves. There is a real economy and real jobs to worry about. Unfortunately, all this is likely to prove is that it will implode the economy. The Liberals (and their Alberta NDP buddies) are showing their complete lack of business acumen with such stupid moves.

eng_test_4557	Yup, the SoCreds rushed to prosecute the inside traders under feeble BC trading statutes, since they were more likely to be convicted under Ontario Statutes, while likely not in BC.   The Prosecutor also refused to get local call information from BC Tel, even though BC Tel was collecting it routinely as part of their push for local measured call billing. Telcos have been using paper tape Automatic Message Accounting data to record every local call since the beginning of direct dialing, but instead of getting a Judge's Order to produce it the Crown speculated about whether local calls had been made (wire line phones in those days).  Sort of like the NDP deciding not to use the videotape of a logger assaulting an environmentalist, saying that their appointed prosecutor could not locate a VCR player and TV to use in the court, leaving it to the jury to decide between logger said / tree hugger said. The video had been widely broadcast on TV news and left no doubt about the assault.

Obama put his sword down, Putin kept his hidden behind his back.  In 2012 Obama scolded Romney for regarding Putin's Russia as a major threat to the USA....Obama gave what he thought was a zinger mocking Romney's 1980's foreign policy .  Romney was right.  Putin's intelligence organizations increased their tempo....his  disinformation agency , inherited from Stalin, is massive... its agents pop up with misinformation and fake news everywhere, we find them on forums such as this .  That they acted under Obama's nose with impunity is a sad fact...Hillary may well have been a casualty of Obama's and her own naïveté.

Those six thousand Alaskan voters who put you over the top against Parnell, (who wrote SB21 with Exxon), as well as all the other supporting voters who put faith in you, should be beaming for having won that much for us all. One last chance to stop the slope cartel`s extortion through political favors, and control of access to our resources. The rest is up to us in November.

eng_test_4567	Speaking of a horses backside, is that where your head is at?
eng_test_4568	Again, I contend your comment was indeed inappropriate and slanderous. The people you are referring to are those who go where most of your 'sophisticates' won't and they are very good at what they do -  as is proven by the infrequency of accidents of this nature. Also, if you're trying to tell me that 'sophisticated people' are incapable of mistakes, I'm not buying. History is too well littered with their misjudgments and idiocy to embrace that canard. I would add that the current conceit of the few that the many are intellectually inferior is as unoriginal as it is tiresome.   (The Queen of the North's loss had nothing to do with sophistication. A career officer was distracted to the point of egregious dereliction of his duty.)
eng_test_4569	Looks like all teachers MUST be placed on the No-Fly list now. And teachers should not be allowed to buy guns either. Clearly, ALL teachers are lunatics that can't be trusted. We must remove all teachers from the classroom. We must make schools Teacher Free Zones.

eng_test_4594	Now that is a load of B.S., Gerald. Number one, there are not enough well-paying jobs to go around to offset the cost of living in Alaska, let alone bush Alaska. So, according to your premise, those in the bush should move into urban centers to "better" themselves and their prospects because they should "compete" with others in their aspirations? The economy will not support them, it already barely supports those who already live within the urban paradigm with its cheaper cost of living. So where do you propose to put them, those seeking higher incomes and failing that, besides prison, that entity that feeds you? The cost of living in the bush is already twice and three or four times as high as that of living in the "Big Village." Why the PFD should not be messed with and why a flat tax remains so unfair to those already paying much higher costs than you just for life's essentials. BTW, did you move to Alaska from somewhere else? You seem to have a profound misunderstanding of Alaska.
eng_test_4595	And who do you see as setting the agenda in Juneau Steve? Who do you understand holds complete control of any legislation being debated in Committee let alone on the floor and then voted on? You know damn well that the GOP totally dominates the agenda and nothing can move without the caucus approving and no one in the caucus is allowed to disapprove. The lack of leadership belongs to those in control of the purse strings and that has been the Republicans for a long, long time now. Your false equivalency is a ploy to divert attention from the legislators in Juneau who were incapable of setting an agenda that dealt with their number one job which is balancing the budget. Nothing the Dems offered was considered in committee let alone allows to come to the floor for up or down votes. Nothing of significance happened because the GOP legislators would have to make uncomfortable and politically risky votes just as the Governor did when he submitted his balanced set of cuts/revenue increases.

eng_test_4614	This is great! The article mentions the availability for new and expectant moms, and in one place, for grandparents (great to mention the importance of them as well). It's a common social oversight, but the article neglects fathers.  First, the programming and the people involved do say that this is for new parents (not just expectant moms) and babies, so it is the article text that is incomplete.  (The headline is great -- the first sentence is incomplete). In fact, some of the training videos are targeted toward father involvement. It is wonderful that the program would also support fathers, both in related births as well as adoptions, so it would be great if the article accurately reflected fathers in this program as well.

Nothing happened except BC laughing at the term.  And now, three months prior to an election, Christy finds a renewed vigour in once again addressing BC outside of her developer friends in Vancouver.  Total failure with one exception;  West Kelowna, the seat that Christy bought when she lost her Vancouver seat in the last election, has had over $3b tax dollars spent on highways, bridges, access roads, overpasses and transit systems in an attempt to buy her next seat.  Seriously, did she really need to spend $500m on a direct route bus transit system from West Kelowna to UBCO  which resulted in an increase of 30 passengers per day?  That works out to $16m per passenger; yes $16,000,000.00 per passenger.  In the past weeks, she has announced a further $500m on new overpasses and streetlights, if she is re-elected.

This is what you advocate, no matter the rhetoric you use to try to confuse or sugar coat the idea. Progressivism is theft from the useful by the useless, nothing more.  The only acceptable option is a FAIR TAX, based on a flat percentage of income, same rate for all, no exemptions, no exceptions. NO WAY should success be penalized and sloth or incompetence rewarded. America is about equal opportunity, not equal outcome. If you chose no education and a crap paying job (like "community organizer" for example) you have no one but yourself to blame and your envy of and anger at others success is pathetic.  What an idiot. The last person we need to hear from after the last 8 years is another damn 'community organizer', because that approach has worked so well, right.
eng_test_4634	You are insinuating that people that don't agree with your opinion are morons?  I personally don't care how a particular reporter votes.  They are individual citizens with the right to keep their voting record private.  If you have a problem with fairness in reporting on a particular story, then join the discussion.  If you are here to declare how smart you are and how stupid everyone else is, I suggest you find a different forum.
eng_test_4635	God people are so stupid. Go watch wag the dog
eng_test_4636	Still fixated on Mrs. Clinton?  Pathetic.
eng_test_4637	Agree. The issues around nuclear are what will make it a stop gap solution until renewable energy tech becomes more cost effective and reliable.
eng_test_4638	duped, hornswaggled, intellectually defrauded, .....there are many phrases which describe the process Trump used to convince voters he was the "savior" of the country.....I think they're all quite accurate.  People actually accepted Trump as a "populist".....in fact he's about as far from a true populist as possible.  Trump was born into the wealthy, elite class and has never actually "worked" for a living in his life.  He's used selective bankruptcy as a tool which has bilked small businesspersons and workers out of millions of dollars.  Indeed, he's "fooled" and continues to fool many Americans.  (cont)
eng_test_4639	Nicely done!. Kudos to both teams and the fans. And of course, the Olsens. "The impossible takes a little longer". I hope Coach Carroll was watching.
eng_test_4640	I hope the "People's Republic of Eugene Government" makes sure they work with the boneheads at LTD for an EmX line to the new city hall. Oregon was a state of trend setters.... what has happened??? Stupid People running everything. Time to move.
eng_test_4641	Uhh, Yes. Once contaminated, always contaminated.
eng_test_4642	Talk about stupid Lana  Please read the definition of the PFD  (AS43.23.095) (5) "permanent fund dividend" means a right to receive a payment from the dividend fund; Wake up Alaskan!!!
eng_test_4643	You hucksters are used to having a President you can push around, put words in his mouth and you've met your match in President Trump.  He has exposed you all as con men, liars and fake reporters.  Go Trump!

eng_test_4646	Nope.  Just curious, because for the life of me I cannot understand how anyone could disagree with this article.  However, you may have a point as it is entirely likely that any response will be worthy of tearing apart.
eng_test_4647	Trump's undisciplined, impetuous nature continues to cause problems.  He is like a retarded toddler in need of a sitter.  Sad!!!

eng_test_4650	What message?   "Grab her by the P...."? "Mexicans are rapists?"  I don't think that's a good idea.
eng_test_4651	I don't care about who was protesting what, or whether it was peaceful . The fact remains that these guys are nazi morons, and they want us all to know it.  Freedom of speech my behind. There is a war starting, and scum like this is the enemy. Stamp them out.
eng_test_4652	Agreed. 'Keeping a country unified and working towards a common goal is hard work.' But it starts at the top. And all Canadians have to do their part.
eng_test_4653	Bro HART just canceled a $250,000 audit that may have pointed out lessons to be learned in trying to complete the project. The fact is though, bottom line, Honolulu cannot afford this train to nowhere that no one will ride. Everything will have to be raised - everything including property taxes - and all for extremely little public value. As Ben Cayetano said from the start - bottom line is this rail project is not worth the bang for the buck.
eng_test_4654	Right. ADN always has "right wing idiots" columns. Jenkins and who else and how often. Rarely! Some people will never admit the obvious: that ADN IS a liberal newspaper that has almost no balance.
eng_test_4655	The Chinese President must have complimented Mr. Trump's hair.  This after Trump railed for months about how China is "raping" the U.S.  Trump is a psychotic.
eng_test_4656	So, since the wars are over, the cruise missile attack into Afghanistan which killed the leader of the Taliban last week must be a war crime .  It was specifically authorized by President Obama according to his press secretary.  What other justification is there for killing an Afghani leader in negotiations with the Pakistani government to cease hostilities while he is driving through Pakistan after receiving medical attention in Iraq if it is not during a 'war'?    And the cruise missile attacks into Yemen to support the Saudis and the daily bombings in Iraq from Italy by our Air Force and from our aircraft carriers are also post-war atrocities.    No.  Tom, the wars are not over, just being conducted with different weapons and fewer deaths---at least of our people.  You are doing a Bill Clinton - trying to define a word so it meets your needs, not the reality recognized by non-believers.  "I did not have sexual relations with that woman!"    These are not 'wars'!  Ludicrous. Pathetic
eng_test_4657	Realistically chances are he will kill someone else ...  And bully loser that he is he will probably continue to beat up women - this isn't his first dv issue ....
eng_test_4658	Tjoepstil, there is absolutely nothing that is "virtue signalling" about discussing cause and effect. It doesn't require sophisticated understanding to appreciate the principle that humans and our food sources have evolved to exist within a specific spectrum of climatic conditions and that accumulations of industrial output that add new chemicals into these systems make these systems different from what we have evolved to need. Is it virtue signalling to say that it's good for humans to spend some time in the sun, to breathe oxygen, or to not eat plastic that is contained in current fish populations?
eng_test_4659	Where are Hillary's siblings?
eng_test_4660	Transferring public schools money to a private for profit corporation is indeed unconstitutional and I would hope that if this bill ever makes it to the Governors desk he will veto it. This move by Geisel is simply more transparent ideological privatizing for the sake of campaign contributions.
eng_test_4661	Yeah, you sound like a liberal for sure. Take away his freedom to speak. By the way, the Beavers are losers.
eng_test_4662	They should ban these vehicles effective 2030. Why wait the extra 10 years? China is doing this effective 2025 and, I think, India is 2030. In Canada, we should be considering something similar, while doubling down on renewable/clean energy production and the building of a recharge station network across the country. We could also be investing in research on how to create longer-range and faster charging batteries.
eng_test_4663	I think you have your flow of information in the opposite direction of reality.  There are plenty of rich professors in the world, from rich families or who have become rich through their own efforts.  Many rich professors in Shanghai or Beijing or Hong Kong or Moscow or Tehran would be delighted to move to Vancouver, and the house price would be a small price to pay for the benefits (citizenship, opportunities for children).
eng_test_4664	Meggy: Vetting? Only somebody really dumb would believe that a person being vetted would say 'sure, i will beat my wife', or 'sure, I plan on starting up a new Orange Order'.  Gimme a break, meggy.
eng_test_4665	Dylan roof was a mentally ill little scum bag and McVey was likely a cointelpro patsy...it's remarkable that the left's love affair with Islam considering the things Islam stands for are in such stark contrast to liberal western thinking. I think because the left and Islam both oppose Christianity and Americanism it an enemy or their enemies type of thing.
eng_test_4666	They have NO excuse. They saw many emails hadn't been read, so why didn't they put a New Image Hosting Policy video that pops on their site the minute people go to it? This would have given people notice easily that this was going to happen soon.  You know why they didn't? Because it gives people time to move their stuff off photobucket and to somewhere else. they wanted to catch folks off guard and hold their photos for ransom, so people who have used it for years and have hundreds of thousands of pictures on their sites, can't afford to NOT pay that 400 to keep them up.  But photobucket fucked up, because I'm sure many of the folks who were strong armed into paying, won't be on their greedy little site next year. If i were them, i'd spend whatever time i had for the rest of the year to make sure i have ALL my stuff off and onto a site that respects its users.   The price is RIDICULOUS. I may have considered 20.00 a year or so but 399? Bitch no!
eng_test_4667	Both great tips! I've been battling lens condensation for years, it's rough. Best thing? Wrap your lens with those little heated handwarmers, Hot Hands. I use a strip of velcro (from Michael's Crafts) to hold one around the thickest part of my lens. It works great to keep the lens *just barely* warm enough not to fog up. I've tried every other trick Google found in a vast internet of hacks, nothing else helped.   Headlights are annoying, but remember, sometimes you literally can't turn off the lights when the engine is on. Subarus, for example, have daytime running lights. If my keys are in the ignition, the headlights are on, like it or not.
eng_test_4668	WOW what complete bull.  I guess it OK to let individuals decide they do not want to pay for health care needs and let the rest of us pay for what they needed. Because that is where we are headed.  I read today that the new plan will cost less because admittedly it will cover less. How is that a better deal for Americans.  Higher co-pay is not a solution its just another inconvenience.   Before it is over America will return to the 50's when the simplest heart attack was a death sentence.
eng_test_4669	YES!  That stupid water pipe is just a fatal accident waiting to happen.
eng_test_4670	... you must enjoy blissful ignorance yourself ...
eng_test_4671	Spicer needs to visit a Nazi gas chamber....
eng_test_4672	These pathetic weeble-wobbles are overusing the 'hater-card' against whomever disagrees with 'em just like another set of similarly pathetic weeble-wobbles over-use the 'race-card'.  All this means is that no one is taking you seriously anymore.
eng_test_4673	The bottom line is HRC wants the fingers of government in every aspect of our lives. From her controlling our healthcare. With the new Hillary care that will be in effect if she is elected. To not wanting us armed because we have her to protect us. It's sad that her followers won't see it until it is to late. The government will own you if she is elected.
eng_test_4674	He just voted for people to die that have the same condition he has. All republicans are sociopaths.
eng_test_4675	145th Wing, California Air National Guard?  As a former member of the CA Air Guard, never heard of this unit.  There is a North Carolina 145th Guard unit that flies C-130s.  https://search.yahoo.com/yhs/search?p=145th+Wing%2C+California+Air+National+Guard&ei=UTF-8&hspart=mozilla&hsimp=yhs-005
eng_test_4676	None of your far flung examples has an arrogant fascist barking insults, lies, hate, and stimulating violence like trump.  The American political arena was once a safe place to support or object to candidates. Now you're saying, if you plan to protest or object to DT, you put yourself in danger. The people who attend these meetings are short on civility and with trump egging them on, it's dangerous but standing up to evil shouldn't include getting sucker punched by some loser who wants to see himself on TV.
eng_test_4677	Taxpayers paid how much for this study?  DEMs never want to cut spending; they'd rather find more ways to raise taxes so they can spend more. Time to UN-shackle taxpayers and CUT SPENDING!
eng_test_4678	Kindly refrain from personalizing a huge, complex problem unless, like the heart surgery survivor, it is germane to what is being discussed.  Throwing out a simple amendment idea to what is being proposed surely is a waste of time, wouldn't you agree?
eng_test_4679	If you are against a LEGAL cannabis economy, you are either an idiot or a criminal. Which one is Assemblymember Kowalkee from the Mat Su?
eng_test_4680	All this from a governor who INCREASED spending!   Don't look so smug democrats.  If memory serves, Fran Fans were clamoring for the PFD...back when the fiscal crisis wasn't nearly as dire.   Regardless of what party holds the purse strings, it's NEVER enough for .gov  profligate: carelessly and foolishly wasting money, materials, etc.: synonym: ak.gov  frugal: careful about spending money or using things when you do not need to : using money or supplies in a very careful way:  antonym:  ak.gov
eng_test_4681	You use the term "bees".....actually I'm guessing you were experiencing "yellow jackets"...not honey bees.  There's no reason honey bees would be out in those open playing fields... However, yellow jackets live underground and often have their little homes in those open fields.  Additionally, this time of the year they are really unpleasant little fellows.  They're aggressive and their stings really hurt.    Other than massive pesticide spraying....which I hope the schools do NOT do, all you can do is a)don't go barefoot and b) avoid the little rascals as much as possible.  Let's leave the honey bees alone, they're having a tough enough time surviving as is.  regards, Gary Crum

eng_test_4685	Why either or?   I would certainly like to see the criminal Zuma/Gupta thieves in prison.  And look what happened recently in Masiphumelele/Hout Bay.  The protesters attacked the very people you are calling upon - the supportive community.  I think the writer also needs to move out of the theoretical to the practical.
eng_test_4686	i will be going to the usa often with trump as i  did with obama in power regardless of all the harmfull and stupid policies he did. at some point you have to act like a mature person and understand it is not our place to judge what the usa does for it's own security.

eng_test_4688	In 2011 the FTA and the city put together a comprehensive Risk Report for rail.  This report has been hidden from the public by HART.  I do not think our elected representatives have read this report.  The report has not been in the press.   If you read the report, you understand that building rail through downtown Honolulu is so problematic that there can be no fixed price.  The report is filled with risks that are 90% sure to happen and each one could delay construction for up to one year.
eng_test_4689	So instead of using the distribution and commercial network already established to sell one type of vice the infinitely stupid Wynne and her cronies are going to set up a separate enterprise staffed by more overpaid unionized government stooges to sell another vice.  Anyone still confused as to how Ontario owes 300 Billion in debt and keeps adding to it?
eng_test_4690	Well of course you can't produce a video link of Trump according to you "standing behind Clinton, giving her the finger, and making humping movements" because none ever existed. What amazes me so is when those who tell lies are caught red handed lying and yet are stupid enough to double down on the first lie with more lies or some other such nonsense.   I'm betting psychologist will coin a new medical terminology for compulsive lying and call it the Hillary Syndrome.
eng_test_4691	Thanks God this scumbag was not elected President.He would had been a white Obama
eng_test_4692	What a load of cods-wallop.  Those in the temperance movement, and make no mistake, that's exactly what MADD is - a temperance movement,  are fond of using scientifically unsound catch-phrases such as "Impairment Starts With The First Drink."  The author of this piece is cut from the same cloth.    Unless we have 0.00 as the only acceptable Blood Alcohol Content, then we must by definition, establish a BAC level beyond which one is considered impaired.  Which means in the converse, below that limit, one is not considered impaired.  It must be set at some level.    There is no basis upon which to justify a change to 0.05 from 0.08 as being that ideal limit.  This is completely a political decision, not borne of research, science or evidence.    Wasn't it Trudeau who pledged "evidence-based" decision making in his government?  What a hypocrite!
eng_test_4693	Eisenhower warned against the military industrial complex; he might have done us a favour and added the 'industrial complex'. The latter represents the power and proclivity of industry to hijack and convert science to its own profitable ends. For a half century, the sugar industry, so-called scientists and unwitting medical practitioners perpetuated a hoax on the world. It convinced us that fat, not sugar, was the cause of heart disease. Millions cut dietary fat only to become fat, diabetic and prone to heart disease.   I have huge sympathy for victims of melanoma. And yet it is inevitable that after industry has pocketed billions exploiting an irrational fear of the sun, real scientists will pronounce the whole thing a scam. Indeed they have already done so by declaring that genetics (phenotype) and repeated sunburn - not normal, sensible exposure to sun - are the real risk factors. Demonization of the sun has created a generation of draculas whose health has suffered needlessly.
eng_test_4694	It's not about "law and order"... It's about overthrowing a duly elected president because the establishment who want him out can't vote him out.

eng_test_4698	DS: You're right.....it's not exactly a big-time tourist attraction.  However, If you're going to meet someone downtown, it's a good central location and does need a name.....with the Kesey sculpture and frequent reference to it as "Kesey Square" it shouldn't be a big deal to name it.  But, hey, this is Eugene and absolutely each and every decision, regardless of how petty or how large, becomes a big deal.  Gary Crum
eng_test_4699	This is a pet peeve of mine. I'm not sure that "iconic" qualifies as an idiom, but the lazy, mindless use of this word by journalists and announcers has robbed it of almost all meaning. Offenders, stop saying "iconic", you're being moronic.

eng_test_4701	Cummings is a moron...obviously. always wanting GOP members to appear in an open session, but never one of his party. Of course the GOP will never go after anyone because they are pathetic. If they wanted to they could bury the entire Obama administration, but they're a bunch of lazy do nothing swamp monsters. That Obamacare replacement might as well have been blank paper.

eng_test_4705	"Close editing'?  You mean it's too much trouble to read what you wrote?  Or it costs too much money to read what you wrote?    Back when computers were two story buildings, (Late 1960s), when a professional, like an attorney or a reporter or an editor or someone else whose sole product was their own written words, one person would actually read aloud to the other person those actual written words (to include punctuation),  while both had hard copies of the document(s) in front of them.   This was to ensure accuracy.    It worked.  Typos, misspellings, omitted or incorrect punctuation; all that sort of thing were not acceptable to 'professionals'.  It was often referred to as 'attention to detail'.  It applied to CPA's and other 'professionals' as well.  A 'professional' did not put their signature on a document without verifying its accuracy.
eng_test_4706	Two points I would like to make 1. If you did not vote in the election you have no right to bitch 2. We Canadians get pissed off when Americans come to Canada and try to tell us what is wrong in our country. WTF are Canadians doing in DC protesting!!!

eng_test_4709	This Trump Hate being endlessly whipped up by MSM is beyond ridiculous.  If you have half a brain you can see how desperate the Deep State is to invent something they can impeach Trump with.   There's nothing there, folks.   Meanwhile here in Canada, thousands of fake refugees are pouring across our border.  MSM is busy keeping all you liberal types focused on hating Trump so you don't notice what's happening in our own country.  You are being played for fools.

If China does nothing the US will be in the same place as it is now and can pursue other measures. To my knowledge NK has not threatened SK militarily recently.
eng_test_4712	Ah yes. Polls. The same polls that trumpeted a Democratic win south of the border. So soon we forget.
eng_test_4713	Just another opinion piece by an elitist, socialist parasite with absolutely no knowledge of the real world. Sadly there are too many of them spouting their endless anti-progress drivel and the point has been reached where Canada is at the bottom of the ladder in its inexorable descent into something lower than the lowest common denominator.

Solar panels WERE on the White House but were taken down by Reagan.  This would be GOVERNMENT working to improve the world, not just the USA.  Demanding inefficiencies in ALL GOVERNMENT facilities wouldn't be a budget breaker.  In the long run it would save money and improve our environment.  What are the Kochs and their minions doing for PEACE.  It WILL TAKE GOVERNMENT interference to demand negotiation vs the war machine manufacturers.  What are the Kochs and their minions doing for JUSTICE.  (I'm out of characters for further ...)

eng_test_4738	What an absolute hypocrite you are being here Ousider77.  You are always passing judgement on the criminal justice system here on the RG website:  criticizing the police, prosecutors, and the courts regarding many local criminal cases.    You also frequently defend people accused of sex crimes, even in some cases where they have confessed, and now you are defending a filthy, dirty, cold blooded murderer??   That is simply outrageous behavior by you.  Your values sure to seem to be backasswards to me.  Raping women and children is EVIL.   Murdering people is EVIL.   Those who commit such vile sins will be damned by God himself, and will suffer for all eternity, consumed in the fires of hell.

That person deserves a punishment far worse than anything that JadedJade can possibly imagine doing to him here on earth.
eng_test_4739	Most conservative Americans are marginally literate, do not understand the USA constitution, and are, as a result, extremely gullible to a skilled conman like Trump.

eng_test_4741	The obvious confounder here is that she's also angry at China for barring her from a beauty pageant.
eng_test_4742	To all those emoting about more gun laws such as those working out so well in Chicago (not):  When we have more gun control laws,  what is your plan for keeping criminals and those intent on evil deeds from getting guns?  What's the plan for getting rid of the Black Market in guns which will burgeon with more gun control? What's your plan for keeping people from killing themselves with drugs?  What's your plan for keeping DUI folks from killing people?  It's never about the objects; it's always about what people do with the objects, whether they be plastic bags, styrofoam containers, drugs, knives, or guns.  How about we require everyone over a certain age to own a gun and be trained in how to use it?  The security and safety of law-abiding people must be insured.  When only criminals and the government have guns, We, the People, are finished. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAXxQBIfH7I
eng_test_4743	LW 1: I'm having a difficult time understanding what your issue is (the same is true of many other letters to Amy lately-- they all seem to be from The Book of Who Cares. There's nothing creepy about visiting elderly/infirm people-- in fact I find it far creepier to fixate so much on who your neighbor visits and why. Get a hobby.
eng_test_4744	This entire event speaks volumes of how pathetic Oregon's society has become. I'm truly ashamed and embarrassed...

eng_test_4751	So the hateful right-wing media attacks trump and you're getting upset? Poor little snowflake! Do you need your safe space?
eng_test_4752	I'd agree as well. Good riddance.
eng_test_4753	I LOVE this article for it proves that the Jesuits are hypocrites!  They hide behind the Church's skirts when it's convenient.  Shame on them.
eng_test_4754	Sneaky rat editor is pulling some crap on me. Here it is: What the...did I pick up the wrong paper? An article not bashing America on the opinion page? I declare that a first in this paper's history. There's always a dig against patriots somewhere. I think it's part of their disguise, they have decided to try to pose as objective reporters? Ha. I'd help. I would write a letter to the editor, but he won't print it. It's not his fault, I just can't write any such letter without starting with,"Dear miserable @#$!! traitor rat%%^#! What can I say, I loath an America hating commie rag.
eng_test_4755	Yes, I know Republicans. Most of them are racists. They believe things like welfare mothers, gang members and drug users are all black or brown. That blacks are lazy, Asians are smart, white people were meant to rule. That has been my experience.
eng_test_4756	Clearly, your sister is an idiot. She can see him as president, even knowing all she does about him? Amazing.
eng_test_4757	aa chris you paid liberal troll, trudeau gets criticized so much for all the pathetic stupidity he says, does and is doing to canada from the majority that will not be voting for him in 19! (better get your resume ready)
eng_test_4758	This bill will hurt tens of thousands of Alaskans by kicking them off their health insurance. All so the GOP can come back later in the year and give a big fat tax cut to corporations and rich people. Those who lose their insurance will end up using ED and other uncompensated services and all Alaskans will pay more as a result. Why are we doing this to ourselves? Just so the GOP and Trump can "win" by abolishing Obama's legacy? This will be a Pyrrhic victory for Trump's Alaskan supporters.
eng_test_4759	This administration is disgusting.
eng_test_4760	Just when the CPC thought it had navigated safely (actually rather well) through the dangerous shoals of a leadership contest at a time of underlying deep policy divisions.
eng_test_4761	ya and drive whats left of business out of canada.sometimes companies pay taxes on profits without having to hire pal and its still great for canada and people.. take the 40% left wing bs and take a hike

eng_test_4763	Well, the 2007 general obligation bond program went extremely well, under budget in fact, all in the teeth of the subsequent Great Recession of 2007-08.
eng_test_4764	Boom there is it. Mythman scouring the internet on a daily basis waiting breathlessly for the first opportunity to throw his crap at Hawaiians. What a sad and pathetic life to lead. Put down the Haterade brother, it's a sunny day in Hawaii.

Also Lady Gaga is scheduled to do a follow up act, where she plays basket ball with lil kim and the generals while dressed up as Madonna 1978 version and all this is being recorded on I phones to later be shown on MSNBC to Rachel Maddow's devoted fans.

eng_test_4771	Wake up the Cold War was never over as far as Russia was concerned, only the US Liberal idiots beleave it was.
eng_test_4772	This author takes a very jaundiced view of Russia and in fact is simply repeating American propaganda. Certainly the Soviets enhanced their empire but it was with political entities that were adjacent to and contiguous with the main Russian landmass. The US went far a field with its empire encompassing territories separated by large bodies of water such as the Pacific Ocean in the case of Hawaii and the Caribbean in the cases of Puerto Rico and Trinidad, not to mention its control of Haiti and many other nations in the Southern hemisphere. The Soviet's biggest push occurred when a Georgian was at the helm, Stalin! As far as I am given to understand, it was Georgia which started its little mini war by attempting to invade South Ossetia in the middle of the night, not a blatant attempt by Russia to invade Georgia (to me this representation by the author proves his contempt for the truth and his complicity in disseminating US propaganda). Also the Crimeans asked for re-entry to Russia!

eng_test_4780	Clinton is the suicide bomber of American politics: corrupt, greedy, war-mongering, and utterly and deeply dishonest. Trump is the US's (and Canada's) only hope now.
eng_test_4781	I guess Cayetano only likes it when he wastes Hawaii taxpayer's millions....like when he gave millions directly to Trump for hosting the Ms. Universe. Foolish and harmful of Cayetano!
eng_test_4782	So you want to kill projects in Canada, that are undoubtedly held to much more stringent environment regulations, yet you're perfectly content to let energy projects in places like Nigeria or Saudi Arabia to continue to operate, unfettered with no environmental protests, and no environmental checks and balances? Frankly, I'm the one who doesn't follow!
eng_test_4783	Chumming with Gomer Trudeau no longer pays off.
eng_test_4784	I fell in love at The Know. It was one of my life's sweetest stories. Fuck you if you think it is hipster. We were just two broken baby birds who found sollace in one another for a few years. It was intense, passionate, loving, and metal as fuck. Thank you, Know,  for being one of the last places that a normal weirdo in Portland can fall in love.
eng_test_4785	You are merely whinging at us who see Trump as a lying, narcissistic, ignorant, sexist, racist ar$ehole. Since he is a conservative, you of course leap to his defense -- actually, you leap to the attack of those who see him as he is.
eng_test_4786	Lizzy, I am not "right". I am an observer and have no personal investment in this 'case'. 'Truthwillout' aka Phil illy wants to be right. He continues to use multiple handles like the failed "Katty Shack" which he deleted when I called him out . The most recent throwaway handle 'Truthwillout' ,  he is posing as an attorney. Shady people Don't get to call the kettle black. So why is he? I guess the appeals court will decide.
eng_test_4787	Just another way to support our troops by taking away their opportunities.  Stupid kids, don't they realize fortunes are for old rich guys that already have plenty?

Look I dont care about republican or democrat I try to simple look at character period.. stop acting schatz and playing this holly I am fighting for equal rights role your over doing it!!
eng_test_4790	It would be VERY interesting to have an independent draw up a report of the Post Office property portfolio.   It has an immense portfolio often located in great solid buildings in prime locations of especially towns.  That listing needs to be filed before the Guptas buy the post office assets for 20c in the Runt.  Another interesting one will be to see who gets to buy that Telkom stake and for how much?
eng_test_4791	"Being stupid is not illegal."  Man, you must thank God every night for that.
eng_test_4792	Right, because if a female says something stupid, it's always a males fault, right?  And you'd lose your bet.  I'm a happily married grandfather of five.
eng_test_4793	its a pitty ignorant sheep like you are so disrespectfull of free choice and economics to let people decide by thier spending choices what stays and goes, but of course being a fascist liberal you like the idea of raping my pocket for more so you lunatics can feed your friends pockets even though no one wants to watch them
eng_test_4794	Hahaha! I love the headline SA. I'm sure Espero "sees" lots of things. Whether they are real or not, remains to be "seen." Thanks for the chuckle.
eng_test_4795	Oh, look! Dear Leader must be adored again so he preens in front of the dolts who slobber over his every word. There has never been a president more needy and more like a third world dictator. And the Democrats are about as spineless and aimless as jellyfish. We. Are. Truly. Screwed.
eng_test_4796	Phelon is a felon.
eng_test_4797	Really? Most idiotic comment I ever read. So if they "hit" one of your loved ones in their "few times a year" you would have the same opinion as you just wrote?
eng_test_4798	Trump is just part of a horrible and sleazy family.  Why on earth did America elect this fool?  It was a very reckless course.  WE all regret it now.

eng_test_4802	T you should post pictures of the homeless encampment up by the park that's freaking disgusting
eng_test_4803	I agree, But the mere fact the Court agreed to hear the case makes me shudder. If a majority agreed with the Colorado Supreme Court decision, the Court would have declined the case.
eng_test_4804	"In Juneau, lawmakers are grappling with how to fix a state budget deficit topping $4 billion, weighing cuts and new streams of revenue."  I have not heard even one utterance concerning new streams of revenue. Only cuts designed to hurt the most vulnerable of us have come down
eng_test_4805	Transport Canada to enforce these new regs? More bodies on drone patrol.
eng_test_4806	Just reading the first paragraph told me that this guy Feldstein is a fool. The only reason i'd be talking on a cell phone outside my house is that i'm a smoker? This is cheap, trashy, look at the car wreck journalism.
eng_test_4807	I think this bodyguard and other emplyees may be lying like hell purposefully being 'YES MEN" to keep their jobs. the so called incriminating photo of David Mueller, Swift and the third girl is not incriminating. Her dress is not up as she said, The guys hand does not look to be on her butt. Plus third girl in photo says she saw nothing. Swift is smiling in the photo. If this photo is one of sexual assault why the hell is she smiling? The evidence in this case seems damned shabby. I think one spoiled  celebrity lied like hell about this so called assault, stupid jurors believed this idiot because she is a celebrity. The 'little guy" went down and this exaggerating spoiled bitch from hell won. Then she was seen in all the right places like Mariska Hargitays sexual assault fund onstage. Swift makes me sick.She owes Mueller an apology.She goes on to make millions while David Mueller cant get a job. I wish Swift would fall in a damned hole. I am sick of her and her stupid faces.
eng_test_4808	Agreed. Tuck that factoid away for your story later.
eng_test_4809	What, have you taken on the self-appointed role of 'comment cop'? Mr. CLEAN stated his opinion and I commented on it. That is a common occurrence on forums, you've...um...never noticed that? Oh my. Your inability to "see"( or comprehend what is written) isn't my problem.

eng_test_4811	If you deny climate change you are ignorant and uneducated. In jail at least you can't spread your crazy ideals.
eng_test_4812	There is no guilty verdict in a civil suit. The jury either finds for the plaintiff or not.
eng_test_4813	Care to evidence that assertion?
eng_test_4814	If this isn't bad enough, he also let out a self admitted, non-repentant terrorist, Oscar Lopez.  Lopez was offered a conditional pardon before and turned it down because he would not agree to abide by the conditions.   So Obama releases this person...  Obama lets a CIA agent get tried and convicted by Italy for a kidnapping she wasn't even in the country when it happened. He won't help a person that served her country but releases a terrorist who wants to destroy America.  Democrats, he belongs to you and you can have him. I for one cannot wait for him to be out of office. MY ONLY HOPE IS HISTORY IS HONEST ABOUT HOW BAD THIS MAN HAS BEEN FOR THIS COUNTRY!
eng_test_4815	doesn't fit the narrative talking points
eng_test_4816	United did it wrong to save themselves from a lawsuit they should have offered any passengers who would like to volunteer by giving up there seats on a over crowded plane  instead of dragging them off  like they did this doctor the airlines should offer anyone who gives up there seat, we would give them free 4 first class round trip tickets anywhere in the U.S. for future travel and 5000 cash and a hotel stay overnight and catch the next flight it would be cheaper instead of getting sewed.
eng_test_4817	This story has been debunked and you want us to believe trump is a russian based on his daughters name. HAHAHAHAHA  There is no proof but hearsay , but you cant wait to attack like some rabid dog. Your post is the one that is disgusting and a personal attack, but i expect it...
eng_test_4818	So it IS just political grandstanding.
eng_test_4819	Really? Who else would ignore 97% of scientists on subject? That is willful ignorance. They don't and/or won't understand climate change. They're ignorance is going to kill us all. Including an ignorant president who thinks cc is a Chinese conspiracy.  Talk about arrogance. (and stupidity).
eng_test_4820	Kearon, I can't wait for all of these horrible things to happen so that you and your likes leave. All you grifters are working the presses overtime to spew your lies, all to preserve your take. You add absolutely nothing of value. You disgust me.

eng_test_4825	Trump is a massive idiot who did not listen to the military apparatus or the intelligence reports that stated they had no evidence Sarin gas  was used.

eng_test_4828	Then he would be vindicated.  Until then he's an idiot.  Or, more likely, he's a con man who thinks a good many Americans are.
eng_test_4829	By all means hike the rate.  But $500 isn't in the right ballpark.  Maybe $5,000 or $10,000 ... or more.
eng_test_4830	Not a big deal.   Brain Burke signed that one did he not.  Now they got best before 73 in charge.  Watch what that old fool will accomplish for you.   No facial hair, No media riding on the plane,  stupid items like that.   Watch for the trade......  I can see it coming....    Let you decide who and where for what.
eng_test_4831	I'd like to see NCR do more articles on Church art with explanations of the symbolism like this. I do believe that much of it is like an alternative religion, perhaps approved by a local priest or bishop or king or abbess, but not by the 'sacred magisterium' as they call themselves. So more a true expression of the beliefs of the local people.
eng_test_4832	John Kawamoto:  If you speed, you are violating the law.  Parents who sneaked into the US or overstayed illegally have lots of explaining to do to their children.  Because they got away with it for years is nobody's fault but their own.  Illegal is illegal!  Your comparisons are like apples and oranges.  Maybe you should compare a jail escapee who didn't get caught for years and had since had a family for 10 years.  She was then caught but was a good citizen while she was out.  Does that matter?  Only thing that matters would be that she escaped and never finished serving her jail sentence.  Throw her back in jail with additional charges of escape.  That's fair!!!
eng_test_4833	me too, I don't dignify your constant troll comments about mayor Caldwell,  you have posted hundreds of comments denigrating him regarding the hauula fire station when it was your fault.  you like the antis are vindictive and malicious - no shame and no class.  your boy djou is a repub, the fact that the race is nonpartisan does not mean that his party principles will be ignored.  once a fool always a fool.

eng_test_4839	The UA system is frightfully trivial; local physical access, low security policies and lax oversight make for a very vulnerable infrastructure. I'll be the first to admit that it could have been a lot worse, but it should certainly be a wakeup call to the IT department.

eng_test_4843	Watch that blood pressure.  I would love a real discussion, and discussion is more fun with fully informed opponents.  It is not my intention to keep anyone 'on the hook', but encourage them to be informed.  Ronni likes to comment but seems to know little history or factual current events (about you I'm not sure), and answers questions with other questions, as deflection.  He stated we would all be speaking German if Liberals were in charge 75 years ago, and I challenged him to educate himself to history of that period, and about how there came to be two parts of Korea.
eng_test_4844	I read this in disbelief. This doesn't qualify as stupid, in fact it is an insult to stupidity. Does anyone have a word for beyond stupid?
eng_test_4845	St Jerome just inserted the word "hell" where it didn't exist in the manuscripts from which he made is translation? He just put it in?
eng_test_4846	The Liberal's Thought Police are out in full force deleting posts during our Orwellian age under Zoolander:  Original post  So what about fairness and legality of our own Zoolander being investigated for numerous ethics breaches by Mary Dawson? Her findings play exactly the way Zoolander wants even though there were clearly obvious breaches made.  Zoolander still won't answer the question in the House of Commons how many times he was required to meet with the Ethics Commissioner despite being asked 18 times  I'm sure there's tremendous honor and perfectly acceptable if a Liberal skirts the questions and keeps Canadians in the dark about our own PM's ethics breaches and illegal fundraisers.
eng_test_4847	vogel, you must be a dummy like trump.  political correctness is not the problem but stupidity is.
eng_test_4848	Perhaps all those high school graduates failed Civics...or maybe the 'Civics' their 'educators' told them about left out the part about laws passed by Congress as opposed to 'strokes of a pen' that have no binding authority once the guy with the pen is off giving speeches on Wall Street!
eng_test_4849	After an ignorant and meaningless sneer at Pope Francis yesterday, RD posts an equally ignorant and meaningless sneer at Cardinal Cupich. Is that what your Hypernumeray from OD teaches you to do, RD, sneer at your betters?
eng_test_4850	Why is this black racist crap still on the G&M website?  I stopped talking to black people long ago because I was afraid for my life!!!!! Since 80%-90% of all crime is by black people it kinda makes sense doesn't it. Oh wait thats profiling or is it driving while black?  I don't know you LEFTIST MARXISTS and  BLM nutjobs change the names so fast no one can keep up. So what do we do when the facts speak like this? Wash it all away by letting identity Marxists spew their racist hatred of white people? I think not. So because you commit most of the crimes in the world why the why the F would we give you the time of day? Clean up your sh*t first.  You people are the problem... Own it
eng_test_4851	I don't like the Panthers and I'm not a big fan of Valor.  But after watching a handful of games in Christian's last two years in high school, half a dozen games when he was at Stanford, as well as what I've read about him, I just can't help rooting for him.  During the draft I read that one analyst said that McCaffrey was the best route runner in the entire draft, including receivers and TEs.  If they use him right and he stays healthy, I think he could become a big time weapon in the NFL.
eng_test_4852	Could it be The Minnow?
eng_test_4853	Make sure they look like pigs.
eng_test_4854	yep YOUR and idiot since the states will manage the eviro issues just fine with out the feds thus being a clean country all the same
eng_test_4855	You're comparing Canada with HAITI? ("Same things are happening in Canada...")  The ignorance is beyond belief.
eng_test_4856	I doubt he or they have a plan to implement the project, it may take years for them to decide how and Doug Ford will trash their folly
eng_test_4857	I do accept responsibility for what I do. My place in the world is to help and protect those who can't fend for themselves. Not big things, but open a door, help with a bag, maybe mow a lawn or just visit with someone. I don't believe that all humans are intrinsically good. People who harm someone who can not defend themselves - the elderly or children usually - do not get a pass from me. When the murderer is apprehended, there'll be a trial and he (she, they) will be sentenced to however many years in jail where they will watch TV, visit family, make friends - be treated well by taxpayers. After unleashing homicidal violence on a 76 year old woman. I'll concede that the ants may be extreme. A firing squad would be more humane.
eng_test_4858	You are what we call the stupid home piece.  If he can't get some strange you are always available and willing - regardless of how bad you are treated,.
eng_test_4859	Couldn't agree more Benjamin.  This town faces so many issues that are far more important than this bullshit.  Oops, I swore.  How much longer do we have to put up with her?
eng_test_4860	Chances are that your FP works for one of the government subsidized capitation type practices where they get paid per capita , per head, and not fee for service where one only gets paid if one actually sees a patient....with capitation practices one gets paid whether the patient is seen or not.  He could be working , on salary, in a government clinic such as the CHC's .  Fee for service FP's cannot take so much time off because office overhead expenses etc., have to be covered , and patients themselves covered .
eng_test_4861	The last thing this issue needs is more politics and politicians - particularity smug and sanctimonious Kenney.    Kinder Morgan needs to be far more proactive in addressing the (imo legitimate) concerns of the people of Burnaby and Vancouver.  Buying politicians like Harper to do foolish things like close the coast guard base at Kitsalano was entirely foolish and the anger and distrust of that action will stay with Vancouverites for a very long time.  Trudeau opened the base but clearly that's not enough.  Kenney's more of  same Harper short term thinking.  Notley's slow and steady should win the race, but as this author notes, Kenney smells political opportunity and he will tear Notley down rather than work with her to do anything smart on this file.  Poor Alberta with such interlopers as Kenney playing them like barking seals.
eng_test_4862	Ya and she thinks she stands a hope of getting another mandate. What a fool

eng_test_4865	If you read the extensive assessment of SF's efforts to address rampant homelessness, there, you'll see that they provide a rich array of services, like the Navigation Center and transitional housing, but all of that has not reduced homelessness there. Homeless folks use the services, including apartments and hotel rooms,  but continue to spend all of their time on the streets, with their chosen family/social world.    If the goal is to reduce homelessness I'm not sure that emulating SF is the way to go. If the goal is to reduce chronic health conditions and otherwise help the continuing homeless to be more comfortable go ahead with the Navigation Center.
eng_test_4866	More Chicken LIttle political ranting and raving. Trump is returning much of the heavy-handed, bloated, federal guidelines and regulatory responsibilities back over to the states. Those very states that are more knowledgeable about their own needs. And when you speak of lax standards of education, you can certainly lay the USA's poor comparitive world results on the federal government full of it's Democraticly lead education system. It's horrible and the those "standards" that you seem to pleased with are in sore need of improvement. Many of the states hate the meddling of the federal government in the (failing) education of their students. Why do you think charter and private schools have experienced such tremendous growth?! But, you're a liberal Kool-Aid drinker who's only idea is that if it's Republican, it has to be bad. That's why you've been on the wrong team for so long. Now you're just brainwashed like the rest of the sheep.
eng_test_4867	Lisa LaFlamme puts me to sleep. Repeats verbatim of other newscasts. Global airs all crime anywhere anytime. CBC needs to shape up.
eng_test_4868	They've lost the public's respect a long time ago.
eng_test_4869	The individuals that were listed as being part of Caldwell's campaigns that have now moved to Ige's campaign are not players to trifle with. They are all, in many ways, interconnected and plugged into a larger set of people who really have years of experience in running local campaigns in Hawaii, successfully. The exposure of the individuals listed - Imanaka, Min, Yadao, also starts to show the mechanisms that Ige plans to use in order to campaign against Hanabusa for the Primary. Ige ain't stupid, he knows that Hanabusa will bring the full might and power of the Dan Inouye campaign machine to bear in order to win the primary from Ige. So in turn, the machine that worked a win for Caldwell - which was just about as intense - has been negotiated and now working for the Governor.   Get ready, and get informed not only about the candidate on the ballot, but the people behind the candidate really making the moves. Because it is those people, in some ways, that lead the direction of Hawaii.

eng_test_4872	Maybe the idiot who wrote this garbage should do a remedial class on the Fourth Amendment.  The same with border patrol thugs.   TSA gets no respect or sympathy from me.
eng_test_4873	Bill,  The OEC interactive I found put 37% of Canadian imports from Venezuela was crude oil worth $28.3 million in 2015.  The market crash of oil has a lot to do with the decline of our crude oil imports which accounted for 91% ($286 million) in 2013.  Maybe I'm not reading the interactive properly???  Please let me know.  From what I see costanza is correct.  http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/import/can/ven/show/2013/

eng_test_4884	The Trump idolators, climate denies, government -haters, ad nauseum wallow in their evil, destructive ideology right out of 1930s Germany.  The lame response is some amateur psycho-babble blaming all of the ills on those darn messengers revealing the truth of the idiocy permeating our government and national political structure.  Trump and the Republican Party anti-governing traitors are just the culmination of decades of lies, deceit, and institutonal failure leading to this travesty.  Time for a Revolution.
eng_test_4885	Sir, this is an offensive comment, and Trump is truly deplorable.
eng_test_4886	Nearly all the comments on this board are disgusting.  Cowardly anonymous trolls as usual.
eng_test_4887	Don't like it here? Yet, here you are, groveling and flinging trash talk like a puppy in the kitchen garbage bin of your mindless comments.
eng_test_4888	Pray thee tell why. Or are you the only one that gets to call other comments stupid and get past the "civility" filter?
eng_test_4889	> The Ryan plan would hit imports with a 20-per-cent tax while exports would enjoy a 20-per-cent tax subsidy.   So in other words, we'd have "Free Trade" with the U.S. involving a 20% tariff on goods sold to the U.S. and the U.S. would be allowed to give its exporters a 20% subsidy.  Why on earth would any country other than the U.S. agree to such a deal?
eng_test_4890	ya right loser, cutting taxes and regulations growing the us economy, how horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
eng_test_4891	We now know, at the very least, the Trump campaign was open to support from the Russian government by early June 2016 when Trump senior campaign members met with Russians purporting to have information from the Kremlin that would harm Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid, discussed timing for implementing Russian support, and failed to report any of this to U.S. authorities.

eng_test_4900	Is the Journalist here attacking Anonymous Sources? Dangerous!  The article mentioned, not one but twice, that the bank staff complaining to CBC are "unnamed".  Well yes they are and protecting sources in cases like this is a cornerstone of journalistic freedom. Is the journalist here attacking that practice and protection with the two references to the sources being unnamed? Would this journalist suggest that the staff not be free to speak to CBC confidentially about this practice? As it is, the staff already risk being traced to their emails at some point.  I find that mentioning that the staff are unnamed without saying that this is normal and to protect their confidentiality is deeply disturbing. I would have thought the journalist would cheer protection of sources in a case like this. Very dangerous to even subtly indicate that the sources should be named.
eng_test_4901	Lots of hatred from Micronesians toward Hawaiians and it shows in the beatings we are seeing.  In addition, we now have hitmen from the mainland beating up and killing locals.  IT is a nightmare.

Coffee, tea, milk, kombucha, juices, or ice water are all acceptable libation. Still too scared to meet?
eng_test_4915	The really scary thing is that millions of people knew about Trump's connections to Putin and voted him in anyway. Either they're too stupid to know what's going on in Russia or they don't care - either way, scary!
eng_test_4916	What a bunch of useless nonsense.  These naive fools think that the current state of uncivil discourse will be remediated by "let's talk about ways to be nice to each other" events like this.  Take that crap back to kindergarten and give us leaders who have the balls to truly govern.
eng_test_4917	My view is that public discourse (which is what I consider this to be) benefits greatly from being rooted in fact, not conjecture or opinion. If we can discuss the realities involved in an issue, rather than our gut feelings or preconceived notions, everyone wins. Generalities, qualitative statements and name calling don't help.
eng_test_4918	The problem is with the unhinged psycho leftists.
eng_test_4919	What utter nonsense.  By 2021 China will have installed nearly a 100 GW of 3 cent a kwh nukes while Japan will have fired up nearly all of theirs -  50 GW.   With the cost of LNG production alone at $10/MCF - roughly 10 cents a kwh when used for electricity production the market has only a few years left under the current massive surplus and unsustainable prices.  The cost of gas is closer to $10/MCF with the current price $3/MCF a ponzi scam with Big Oil dumping gas in North America to put coal and nukes out of business. Big Oil uses capital to cover operating cost losses in gas.
eng_test_4920	That would be a crime. Don't advocate for criminal activities.

eng_test_4936	Dominic Barton is a private sector and globalists guru that doesn't have Canada's best interests in mind, he's not credible especially when in comes to immigration, as he doesn't care about growing Canadian families with babies nor does he care about helping people make more money in their jobs. There is only one thing we need to do first to fix the Canadian economy and that is decreasing immigration and foreign workers.
eng_test_4937	Mr Orlando claims that Trump himself does not believe 90% of what he says. What evidence does Mr. Orlando provide for this rather bold assertion? If there is evidence, then which part of what Trump says does he (Orlando or Trump) believe, and why? Personally I think Trump believes all of the nonsense he spouts, and his actions so far in office support that view. The man is a catastrophe.
eng_test_4938	You don't know that Melissa doesn't volunteer at a homeless shelter and contribute money to an organization that shelters homeless people. You don't know why kind of marches she's participated in and you don't know that she favors Muslim refugees over any other refugees. American refugees? Where? You're a fraud that hides behind the moniker God Bless America but you don't bless America and you know little about humanity. Your comment is laughable. You're a joke.
eng_test_4939	From what I read it was known ahead of time that there would be no air support in the area to assist.  The chain of command is interesting to me because I'm curious who the military contractors took their engagement orders from.  If there was no air support in the area and there were no other teams working for the administration in the area than what could have been done differently?
eng_test_4940	"i am talking about free speech and if someone has the right to say they hate police and that it is okay to kill police then it is alright for a crazy group like the KKK to voice their opinions." . Absolutely correct.. To add to this, the line is drawn at things like; "Inciting imminent lawless action" or "Fighting words". (Taken from Wikipedia) . When they are chanting their rhetoric like "blacks must go" however ridiculous it is, it IS protected. However, the very second they look at an individual or group and address them directly with that garbage, they have exceeded their freedoms. Which BTW could open a doorway for legal recourse... just sayin'

eng_test_4942	The young will be old some day.  I am 78 now and for about 40 years we owned a small business , where we provided our employees with health insurance.  There were years when the insurance was barely used.  It was a great safety net though when it was needed by young and old.
eng_test_4943	it is the US model of omnibus legislation......cowardly way of negotiating....but, politicians are ALL cowards.....
eng_test_4944	The Tories are not interested in NDP and Green voters.  To win they need to win those voted Tory in 2011, but swung over to the Liberals otherwise Red Tories and Blue Liberals.  Scheer will face a tough time winning those, but it is that group not the progressive swing voters that matter.  55-60% of Canadians lean left and will never vote Tory.  25-30% make up their base who always will while around 10-15% sometimes vote Tory, sometimes Liberal and that is where elections are won and lost.  Scheer unlike Chong is probably not the best one to pick up those voters, but not the worse (i.e. Bernier, Trost, or Leitch) to pick them up.

eng_test_4949	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/world/europe/andrii-artemenko-ukraine-russia.html?_r=0   Former Trump campaign chief blackmailed over meeting between Trump and pro-Russian forces in Ukraine  Former Donald Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort quit Trump’s campaign in August under a cloud of suspicion, but it now appears that more than potential investigations may have been behind his departure. Manafort was also being strong-armed by someone with inside knowledge of under-the-table payments and a secret meeting between Donald Trump and a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician   With charges ranging from leading anti-NATO rallies that encouraged Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, to illegally funneling millions of overseas dollars into to US lobbying firms, to taking more than $12 million in under-the-table payments, Trump’s campaign manager Paul Manafort has brought an extra dimension to Trump’s collusion with Putin.
eng_test_4950	An amusing thing about the right is that they don't understand the left at all.           95% of their politics is motivated by pissing of liberals, but they have no idea what really pisses off liberals.   Well, OK, ...the racism and the homophobia and kicking poor people and similar pisses off liberals, but they're not into that *because* it pisses off liberals, they're just racist homophobes who like to kick poor people.
eng_test_4951	If I may be of assistance, Joe: the article is about the lack of decorum in the White House by a member of the American President's staff.  If you read carefully-- or even just look at the pictures-- you will see it is about Conway, Trump and the USA.   Try to stick to the topic at hand.   If you really need to dump on Trudeau or the Liberals, you have the Sun, or Rebel Media (sic), or even other articles in the G&M, to rant all you want.   Why you picked this article to do so will remain one of the hidden mysteries of medical science,  I suppose.

eng_test_4959	""It would be different pools under different rules," said one senior health policy source..."  Literally the definition of how every other type of insurance works. You select the coverage you determine you need based on your own calculated risk of possible but unlikely events you cannot (or do not want to) realistically save to cover, and are pooled with other similarly situated persons (based on the insurer's actuarial data) to pay costs directly related to the calculated risk they take that you or a significant number of fellow poolees might actually need to use the plan.  If you want broader coverage, you are free to pay for more.
eng_test_4960	One night at dinner in the mid 80's our daughter in elementary school asked if there was going to be a Nuclear war.  I responded that from what I had seen on TV and read in the newspapers I had more confidence in Mr Reagan and Mr Gorbachev being able to resolve their differences when they had a disagreement than I had when she or her younger brother were accusing each other of name calling or not sharing the TV or a toy...the short answer No!  She didn't disagree while her younger brother smirked.  I certainly hope I'm not presented with the same question from any of our grandchildren with respect to Kimmy and Donny...one has already killed his brother and the other has over and over again been caught changing his story and may have done more than sticking girls pigtails in inkwells!
eng_test_4961	Christy is not one of my favourite people. But the only way to make an impact to the American consumer is to highlight that this will cost them additional dollars to build their house. The American lumber barons are wrapping themselves in the red, white and blue but it is their own pockets they are worried about. "Insulting them" (if that is truly an insult) is water off a ducks back!

eng_test_4968	All I got from your post is, "WAAAH! WE LOST! WAAAH!" Funny...you'd GLOAT if Hillary the Criminal won, even if she RIGGED IT. But because you LOST, losers that you socialists are, YOU CRY.  WAAAAH! said the Marxist moron.
eng_test_4969	As a resident of territorial birth, I would take exception with your statement that we have enjoyed the benefits of the oil industry. In my view, initially this industry was a two-edged sword. Today, I view this industry as being the enemy, having destroyed the community we used to be. I will never forget the Bill Allen affair and seeing cash being handed from lilies to legislators and the FBIs intervention with the CBC. Obviously, this situation has not changed.

Because remember what Karma is!!! You have sweet dreams Rick, I'm sure your tired! You've been at this all day.

eng_test_4974	Here are your "cites"; Donald Trump is president.  Apparently watching the events unfold in real time in full color isn't enough proof for you and your ilk so the remaining sane people in this country just "cited" their evidence.   please go back to that moist dark rock you live under.  D or R, if what she did and said after Benghazi doesn't incense you there is something fundamentally wrong with you. ...and if it had happened under GWB your opinion would be 180 from what it is. that makes you a super hypocrite.
eng_test_4975	It's not unkind, it's practical-- and in case you missed it, my father died, so I'm no stranger to grief. I think what the LW is doing is unhealthy.
eng_test_4976	You are an idiot. Laws were broken and US assets were sold by unauthorized personnel who gained financially benefits from the sale. If this were a republican, you would be screaming for prison time.
eng_test_4977	You Trumpsters are such illiterates...

eng_test_4979	Allie, either you go out and get yourself loaded up with guns and ammo of all kinds to protect your your North Dakota a$$ and rejoin the United States and fight for our freedom, or be a NK Beeatch like you seem you are. i'm not saying our Potus is right, i;m saying when any President of our country say's to fight...dam it we fight to win, we don't need scum bag's like your self breathing what ever air we have left.
eng_test_4980	Sticks & stones ... you know the rest. Best we all, including the President, ignore trivial Tweets, media insults, etc. President Trump foolishly takes the bait. His advisors need to encourage him to let most of the BS slide off his back.  We citizens are smart enough to see thru the ridiculous sniping, & Trump should leave things at that.  Most of us learned this lesson in early grade school. Truly important things - a ground swell of basic changes from overly socialized to reasonable government need to be addressed. This twitter is nothing but an unconscionable waste of time & emotion. Trump is in position to be a great game changing President, but he is preoccupied with twitter trivia.

eng_test_4985	I have to question the personal character of anyone who supports Trump. If after everything we have seen and heard from Trump and knowing that he gave potentially life endangering top secret info to Russia , put a man who was already under investigation into the NSA etc etc etc ...I have to assume that you are a low life scum bag who would steal others blind and worse . If you are a Trump supporter after all is said and done , you suck as a human being
eng_test_4986	These people were idiots. We were on the road when they went passed us going well over 100 mph. I was driving the car and had a group of friends in 2 cars behind me.

The whole coaching staff should be fired and investigated.

All of the other 46 states that have honest sales taxes exempt food and medicine from the tax.  Measure 97 does not and as the RG has pointed out earlier, grocery stores will be one the prime recipients of 97.  The problem with this state is that most of the major tax measures are the result single issue interest groups ballot measures.  Measure 97 was devised by the public employees unions to make sure they are taken care of while dishonestly telling the public the "rich corporations" will pay it for us.

eng_test_5010	Does anyone remember the Stuxnet virus. The one which made those Iranian centrifuges spin out of control? Israel and the US were falling over themselves to claim credit for it.

I fear that one day these drone assassinations will come back to haunt us the same way.  We should always think long and hard before we open up a new can of worms since those chickens might come home to roost.

Unfortunately the US put us in this position when they declared a trade war against all and sundry, thereby making us wide open to further economic colonisation by China. Hope they like doing business with their next door neighbour when it's sovereignty is completely liquidated and it's total economy has been sold to the highest global bidder.  I don't see any light down this path for either the US or Canada. The benefit of treating your best trading partners fairly might be greater than it appears at first glance.

eng_test_5038	I agree !  Rep. Oral Freeman, was referred to as "a model for the citizen-legislator."    He was one of the folks who joined with Gov.Hammond to support establishing the Ak. Permanent Fund and advocated to lower the income tax.   "He proposed a system to lower state income taxes because that would help working people and because the state, at the time, had more than enough oil money."  '"I don't claim to be a genius,'' he once said. ''I'm just an ordinary citizen with decent human instincts.''   ''It seems to me that the only moral justification for collecting taxes is that the government needs the money in order to be able to provide the services,'' he said in 1977. ''When the government has sufficient monies to provide the services without the taxation, then that moral justification disappears.''   'It's in the nature of politicians to use the people's money to buy the people's votes,'' he said. "That's as natural as politican breathing".  www.alaska.edu/files/uajourney/Freeman.pdf

eng_test_5053	The PSPP is an illusion. The federal government uses it as a slush fund, there are no dollars invested, nothing put aside.

eng_test_5054	If we have money to pay lifetime welfare to abled bodied people in 138 Rural Alaskan communities, then there has been no real effort to cut the budget.

eng_test_5055	Valid point, bad data. The author is correct that labor force participation is as important to understanding the Trump phenomenon as the headline unemployment number, but his shocker figure - 32% of American men over 20 have left the labor market - is deeply misleading because it includes retirees and college students. Anyone with access to Google can look up the salient number, which is LFP for men 25-54, on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics website. For men 25-54, the LFP was 88.2% in 2014, which is  2 points down from 90.5% in 2004 and 3.5 points down from the 91.7 figure in 1994, during Clinton presidency. Those are real, if modest declines, and while I didn't check state-by-state figures, they're probably higher in the Rust Belt. But it's a long, long way from 68%, which is the number the author gives. This, Canadian readers, is why you should always, always be suspicious when you see figures from the American Enterprise Institute, which is a right wing propaganda machine.

eng_test_5069	Can you read? Every economist who has analyzed our budget situation has said that "WE CAN NOT CUT OUR WAY OUT OF THIS MESS!!" Whether you believe that more cuts are needed (and I do) or not, you must also realize that we must come up with new revenue NOW. Many of the people in the legislature have been in the legislature for years. They oversaw the bloating of the budget, the hiring of the enumerable state employees to do the work they supported, the fact that we only had a single source of revenue. Any third grader knows that you are a fool if you only have one source of revenue! Intelligent Alaskans have been asking the legislature to diversify the economy for years - it fell on deaf ears or the legislators in office are too stupid to figure out how to do it. Now, they are little princes and princesses who are overpaid, with flunkies (aides) following them around doing their bidding who are also overpaid, in lavish offices, and they don't even have to do their job. Disgusting.

eng_test_5098	To save themselves.  And to get some kind of future.  Lets take Shaun Abrahams and Karima Brown as case studies  ShaunA was a middle manager at NPA, promoted to chief only because Jiba (and Mwrebi) were too tainted to have any credibility.  But he was probably promoted on condition that he acceded to them who took orders from Zuma.  So he got a better paying job but not much else.  Then Jiba and Mwrebi got chucked out, leaving him man alone in the NPA Zuma project.  As things roll around, he will get the boot and he may be disbarred and he will certainly not have any future in the NPA nor probably in any legal position.  But if he swops sides now and blows the whistle, he may have some future of some sort.  Now to Karima Brown,.

She saw what was happening and jumped ship.
eng_test_5099	Thank you for writing this!  You are so right that many people, mostly liberals, are forgetting that they are Americans first and foremost!   Put aside this political BS.  It's obviously showing that the fake media news again is getting it all wrong.  They thought the Democrats were going to run over the Republicans in the special elections, (including Georgia) but that didn't come true.  (Like the fake polls that are so wrong) Why?  Because many of us are sick of the petty crap that the Democrats/Liberals/ leftists or whatever else names these pathetic crybabies call themselves.  They are pushing so hard to get rid of  Trump when they should be focusing on doing their damn job that they were elected to do  instead of creating all these problems and encouraging violence and hatred!  Trump needs to continue to do his job like he has been and don't get caught up with the Demonicrat rhetoric!  Let them sink their own ship like they are currently doing.

eng_test_5104	OK, that's one opinion.  Of course it has all the fact base of the flat earthers.   The Trump crowd was mostly late to the game.

Poor Patriots got stuck with actual symbols of America to show their support.
eng_test_5105	Canadians are such suckers for electing this guy and his incompetant crew into power in the first place.  When a clear violation such as this is admitted to, we should have the power to recall the PM and hold new elections.  This is just another slap in the face for all Canadians.

eng_test_5108	"biggest bullion-backed ETF"  Seems questionable at best. GLD makes the claim that it is completely supported by physical gold yet it denies your every day investors the right to exchange for any of their listed 'gold'. This alone means GLD shares are just paper by the day's end. Moreover, GLD's prospectus is loaded with weasel clauses that lets the trust get away without the promised gold backing. A good example of this is in the section of the prospectus that states GLD has no right to audit subcustodial gold possessions. I have never heard of any justifiable reason explaining why this audit loophole exists.  I remember there was a well documented visit by CNBC's Bob Pisani to GLD's gold vault. This visit was organized by GLD's management to prove the existence of GLD's gold but the gold bar held up by Mr. Pisani had the serial number ZJ6752 which did not appear on the most recent bar list at that time. It was later discovered that this "GLD" bar was actually owned by ETF Securities.

eng_test_5123	How stupid and I mean stupid are political groups that think increasing taxes on corporations won't end up costing customers more for the corporations products?

eng_test_5127	Gary, There seems to be conflicting data. Here, http://www.vpc.org/investigating-the-gun-lobby/blood-money/, the writer contends that since 2005, the NRA has received between $19.3 and $60.2 million dollars from the firearms industry. (I don't know when the article was written, so can't extrapolate an annual range.) Also shown are donations from firearms industry entities that range as high as $9 million though it doesn't mention if a one time donation or spread out over several years. Here, https://www.quora.com/Where-does-funding-for-the-National-Rifle-Association-NRA-come-from, if the writer is accurate, it shows that the majority of the NRA's income is from membership dues and individual donations. The writer uses the year 2010, which according to the chart, is more or less an average year for the range shown with a total income of nearly $228 million. How does this compare with data you've seen? Would these donations, when compared to total income, constitute huge influence?

But he hides behind his being a "comedian" whenever he goes too far and gets in trouble, which is pretty often.  His racist comments recently about blacks is just one of many things he wished he never said.  Atheist, socialist, racist and hypocrite is the way to describe him in my opinion.  I'll bet he was pummeled as a kid by just about everyone, even the girls.  I can see him running all over the school playground with a bunch of people wanting to kick his butt for saying stupid things!!  On his show if the audience doesnt laugh at his sick jokes he gets mad.  LOL!  That says it all in my opinion.

On the flip side, wasting money on studying megaprojects like the Susitna Dam and the Road to Ambler and the continued tax give away to oil companies is not the correct thing to do.  So vote out the folks who continue to waste our funds on studying megaprojects and continue to send our funds to oil companies that don't need our contribution to make a profit on our oil.

I never quite knew if you were searching for a congregation, personally, or providing an overview of what's around, or a combination of both.

Just one sentence that I did not understand--or if I did I find it condescending, and, in fact, mistaken.  ..."And it has to be said that this cultural current really belongs to the sophisticated: to the educated and urban." ... That cultural current has been alive and flourishing in the Cariboo since about 1975. Come check out our farmers' markets and home-made banjos next spring Russell.

I have been in the oil business in Alaska since 1983 and I met many Alaskan oil workers and they all share the rest of the world's interest in keeping everything save and clean so our nation can enjoy decades of oil to power our Trucks, SUV, Boats, Cars and all the other great things fossil fuels do to make America Great! God Bless America and Alaska's many caring oil workers!!

eng_test_5156	There should be at least four overhead crosswalks, paths that let pedestrians avoid getting anywhere near speeding cars. That many deaths certainly indicate both an emergency that the state should spend a lot to fix, and a systemic failure of traffic engineering. Too much lottery money goes to projects that have far less importance to the safety of the public.   I find it odd that Coburg Road, which these days perhaps has as much traffic, seems to have far fewer serious car-pedestrian accidents.  I am no traffic engineer, but am finding that as a non-car owner, walking about and crossing busy streets is more and more something that takes all my concentration. There is no way I would routinely ride a bicycle along busy streets and trust to the awareness and sobriety of today's drivers.  As has been said, "only the paranoid survive" (Andy Grove, who survived the Nazis and big business, speaking on complacency).  Hugh Massengill, Eugene

eng_test_5159	"he filed the oil and gas leasing report at the time in 1993."  That sounds like reporting correctly to me.  Well, it turns out it was actually 1995.  Now that is a REALLY BIG DEAL.  And 25 years ago no less which now shows a HISTORY of lying.  Are you kidding me?  He disclosed the lease and the rest are minor technicalities.  Plus no indication he did anything in Resources Committee to benefit himself.  And he reported $4100 per year in revenues from the lease.  WOW!!!  look at how he is enriching himself.  That is about half of what we pay on average annually to an Alaskan medicaid patient.  Some said this article was reaching.  I have another word for it:  a joke.
eng_test_5160	(continuation)  There is nothing nefarious about these facts, and perhaps the best way to see that is by analogy with more traditional campaign activities.  Paying operatives to post on social media is analagous to buying campaign ads on TV, radio, and newspapers. For each campaign it is simply a matter of deciding on the most efficient way to spent their money.   The large army of VOTERS/supporter/fans/activists posting on their own time and dime are analagous to citizens discussion the election over the dinner table, at the water cooler, in restaurants, at public rallies, etc.  As for Google, as a retired computer programmer I can assure you that Google uses extremely complex algorithms to generate its results. And Madison Avenue has always been active in trying to draw hits to its clients websites, mostly by embedding "bait" for Google in those sites. Without doubt, both campaigns are doing the same thing. But, once again, it is IMPOSSIBLE to actually control Google, period.

Canada needs less income inequality since that correlates with better living conditions.  The downside of economic growth  includes no improvement in life in Canada, pollution increased.   I hope that business leaders will recognize that their striving for economic growth comes at a cost for all Canadians. Pollution is serious. And what is gained that is of value? Not better living conditions. So why go for economic growth?

It's been crazy fun to learn about scent theory and just how extreme the sense of smell is for a dog.
eng_test_5176	The author raises the valid point that there may be some method to the madness of King Trump. When his opponents are enjoying Alec Baldwin on SNL, they are spending less time fighting the substantial and dangerous changes to America. The easing of emission standards will increase the energy needs of the USA for a long time, since the inefficient vehicles that will result have long and increasing service lifes. Trump is committed to decreasing taxes for individuals and businesses, even though the USA has among the lowest levels of effective (not nominal) taxes in the industrialized world. Once tax cuts go into effect, they are tough to remove, even though many of the problems in the USA are the result of under-investment in services that are handled more efficiently elsewhere in the public sector. Healthcare is the prime example but infrastructure is also a mess and will be made worse by the terribly inefficient Trump plan to address it.
eng_test_5177	Let's face it none of these no names can win an election against a PM who has maintained 40 % range since elected , (now 42%) .   No question that Kevin O would have had a shot of winning based on name recognition and being very media smart. But with him gone the chances of Conservatives winning an election are pretty dim, especially with the disintegration of the NDP.   If anyone thinks that Bernier can win the next election then you must be dreaming in technicolor.  Personally I like O'Toole  Chong and Raitt but they would have a real challenge winning the next election.

(fairus.org)   The state's taxpayers bear an annual burden of more than $2.7 billion as a result of an estimated 275,000 illegal aliens plus nearly 104,000 U.S.-born children of illegal aliens of whom about 78,000 are school-aged.The combined K-12 fiscal burden for the children of illegal aliens in regular instruction and supplemental instruction amounts to nearly $1.6 billion annually.Justice and law enforcement costs result in a net outlay of about $176 million. These outlays include policing, court and prison costs. Health care and social assistance programs add additional costs of $652 million.The average Washington household headed by a U.S. citizen bears an annual burden of about $970 to cover the costs of the state's illegal alien population.Illegal aliens pay relatively little in taxes because of their low earnings and work in the underground economy. We estimate they pay about $203 million in state and local taxes — 7.4 percent of the estimated burden.
eng_test_5195	There was no annexation of Crimea. The claim otherwise is more fake news, meant to hype people up into supporting a position that isn't grounded in reality, but stems from ulterior motives. Crimea's democratically-elected government organized a referendum to rejoin Russia (as they'd been trying to do for over 25 years). After the referendum was successful, Crimea's government applied for accession to Russia. Crimea was an unbound region at that time, not a part of Ukraine, as Ukraine had ceased to exist as a legal or constitutional entity when its constitution was rendered null and void in February 2014 - meaning, there were no Ukrainian laws, and no Ukrainian territory. The outcome of the Crimea referendum has been confirmed as authentic by over a half-dozen international pollsters, and Crimea has invited the UN to visit and witness the situation.

eng_test_5205	A point about the Conservatives and policies. As the official Opposition their current role is to provide a counter to what the government does or proposes. The Opposition party two years before the election doesn't set forth policies that they intend to run on, for the simple reason is that governing party's have  been known to adopt those policies as their own. Governing parties will run on their past accomplishments, a rehash of previous promises and additional new ideas. The Opposition will attempt to capitalize on the failures of the government , while attempting to offer alternatives to the more despised parts of a governments agenda.

eng_test_5208	Congratulations to the Planning Commission for crafting a sensible and flexible solution to this new problem.  I hope the proposed ordinance is enacted.  Something to remember is that rural properties have a very different fire risk than urban ones  --  except where they are on some kind of collective water system, most rural buildings are protected only by their own wells, and will basically burn down if they catch fire.  There really is a safety concern with a giant rural building housing a dozen people that's only built to residential standards.  For comparison, Port Angeles requires new residential construction outside the 4-minute response zone to have sprinkler systems.  I thought about the Dzogchen Ltd "B&B" when I watched a special about the White House last week.  Did you know there are 35 bathrooms in the whole of the White House, including the East and West Wings?  The Dzogchen building will have 25.  Just sayin'.

eng_test_5217	I can't get behind the NO CEO should earn more than 10 times the annual remuneration,  without company size factors,  if a business has 10,000 employees  with the bottom of the bunch earning $22,000 a year,  limiting the CEO to a salary of 220,000 a year does not get you a CEO that can manage an organization that has 10,000 employees.   When it gets you is a person who becomes an expert at out sourcing work to sub contractors out of the company just so they don't need to employ the minimum wage employees.  a CEO with the liability of 10,000 employees easily deserves to be earning near 7 figures.  which would only be earning $100 per employee per year.

The computer models aren't any more accurate today than they were 30 years ago and are widely disputed.  GIGO.  IPCC ignores more accurate satellite temp data and manipulates temp data from land and ocean weather stations.  Often, original data is purposely destroyed, leaving only the doctored data.  Many scientists are realizing AGW is not happening at the rate claimed nor by the causes (CO2) claimed.  There are many man-caused + natural reasons your butterflies are fewer in numbers.

I had a couple of professors warn me that the manner in which I present my ideas/findings would often not be taken well. While I have often paid that price, I still managed to succeed in life (so far). Maybe this small explanation will help in our future exchanges on this subject.  What I recall in my readings of Waldo (though honestly I couldn't remember his name) was that he came from NC as a slave and remained with Lane until the end of either his life or Lane's. It was always rumored that he was a slave but there was no smoking gun proof as far as I know. Waldo very well could have remained with Lane by choice, which is a very disconcerting notion for many folks. The Wikipedia entry mentioned by the article was removed (possible conspiracy?) because I read it and it was sourced.  When I went to look for it earlier today, it was gone.

eng_test_5248	Here is one angle that is not mentioned in the article or by commenters.   You buy a house, pour all your money into paying it down.  Something happens, you lose your job, there is a big real estate crash, whatever.  You can't pay your mortgage and the value of your home is falling or has fallen.  (We don't all live in the GTA or the GVRD)  Upon bankruptcy, your home, car or most other assets can be siezed.  Except funds that have been in a RRSP for more than 12 months. Those are locked in and safe from creditors.   This may be worst case scenario, but diversifying your assets can protect you from events you cannot predict or may have no control over.   I vote to invest the money instead.  If you cannot afford the house with rising interest rates, you cannot afford the house.

eng_test_5253	Roosevelt's enthusiastic language about the Bill of Rights is not entirely accurate.  "Personal liberty and human dignity" would presumably include Negro slaves and Indians, neither of whom were understood to be within the protections of the Bill of Rights until after the Civil War and the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments, for slaves, and much later than that for most Indians, who were not unambiguously considered full American citizens until the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924.  Even for native-born whites, the rights in the first ten amendments were held by the U.S. Supreme Court not to apply to the individual states (which, for example, might have enacted laws contrary to them, with the court's blessing--although most of the states did provide similar guarantees in their own constitutions).  Beginning in 1925, the Court began, selectively, to apply the Bill of Rights piecemeal to the states through the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment.

eng_test_5265	You really do have a reading comprehension problem. The republicans took control of the house in Jan. 1995. The first surplus was in 1998, the three years following that year, 1999, 2000 and 2001 were surplus years. The huge tax increase that Clinton and a democratic congress passed was in 1993 and the deficit for FY 1993 was 255 billion, which decreased to 203 billion in FY 1994. That tax increase, among other things, created the huge win for republicans and allowing republican control of the house for the first time in 40 years. Republicans took control in Jan. 1995, impacting the FY 1995 numbers and the deficit for that FY was 164 billion, FY 1996 deficit was 107.5 billion, FY 1997 deficit was 22 billion and the last year prior to the next 4 years being surplus years. Clinton Re-elected in a landslide? He was not elected in a landslide to begin with, he never got over 50% of the vote in either of his presidential elections. No excuses, just facts.

eng_test_5279	Thanks not how property taxes work. Property taxes pay for municipal services. Toronto I more dense and therefore has a greater municipal service/infrastructure utilisation rate, ergo property taxes can be equivalently lower.  Highways are a provincial mandate. Why should toronto be the only municipality to pay for the highways within its borders using property taxes? Why does mississauga not pay for 401 and qew within its borders? Why should Torontonians subsidise highways in other munixipalities throigh provincial taxes yet not receive the same?   And FYI Toronto is a net contributor to Ontario and Canada via income, sales and corporate taxes, no one subsidises Toronto's needs. Even transit is 80% out of farebox (high compared to other systems).  Municipalities should get more gas tax AND be able to toll. Tolling is also about reducing congestion and making those that do drive time more efficient.   If other municipalities need transit, they should build it like Toronto has.

"The best story was in  Little Rock, Ark., in the heady days after Bill Clinton was first elected President. It was there that Emanuel, then Clinton’s chief fund-raiser, repaired with George Stephanopoulos, Mandy Grunwald and other aides to Doe’s, the campaign hangout.   Revenge was heavy in the air as the group discussed the enemies."

Eickholt was charged not only with driving impaired, but evading, and resisting arrest.  All three charges were class A misdemeanors.  Also of keen interest is the allegation that Eickholt has a federal record.    The News-Miner editor is refusing to share any of the criminal stuff with the News-Miner readers. The News Miner is also refusing to share that Eickholt has been sued numerous times because he does not appear to honor his commitments to repay loans.

eng_test_5297	bavius,  It's true that doctrinaire free-market capitalism coupled with multilateral free trade & the robotics, communications & IT revolutions (while fostering efficient, effective & growing economies) does foster the widening of wealth & income disparities within countries.  It follows that through our public education, domestic taxation and income redistribution public policies, Canada needs to limit & reverse domestic widening of these disparities.  On the other hand, erecting significant trade barriers only retards domestic economic development & itself would be counterproductive to narrowing domestic disparities.  Surely, the current spectacle within the US & in US/Canada trade relations draws into deep question your assertion that "Trump is the cure. Trump is the Canadian workers best friend." on the issue of international trade.

An attentive and informed reader (as you seem to be) will be intuitively aware of that, and take any statistics with an appropriate number of grains of salt. Huff, however, was not addressing how to read stats-based information so much as how to present it scrupulously, that is, in such a way as to avoid manipulating readers' perceptions.  The only way in which Huff's book has become dated is that readers were probably generally more attentive in the 1950s than they are today. His book still has value in that at the very least it will help calibrate your BS detector -- an all-too-valuable tool in today's political climate.

eng_test_5317	Congrats to Simon Daws (Landscape Architect) for his great work in the Springfield area!
eng_test_5318	I know, Vic, too bad we can't be like the other 49 states and D.C., who don't have drug problems. Paint chips and cereal is a bad combo.
eng_test_5319	Isn't issuing tax credits to oil companies an example of government entering private-sector endeavors?  Isn't that working out just as well as the other boondoggles you cited?
eng_test_5320	Trudeau put up a strong defense for his billionaire friends Bombardier and even gave them billions $$.  I doubt he'll support and do the same for the West as he put road blocks, expanded the GHG criteria, and reset the NEB review on EE to kill the project. Trudeau doesn't govern the country for everyone, only to those who votes for him or pay cash for access.
eng_test_5321	Thanks to Charles Wohlforth for maintaining this forum.  Its good to hear alternative viewpoints!
eng_test_5322	Mike is right. You essentially are still on the payroll if you are receiving benefits. Brett do you think companies should be able to prevent their employees from trashing their company publicly? Your logic would seem to indicate no, but I don't.
eng_test_5323	The teaching charism was given to the Apostles rather than those being shepherded.
eng_test_5324	Was the press "adversarial" toward Obama? No.
eng_test_5325	You do know "The Shack" is fiction, right?    I read the book years ago.....written from a more new age or emerging church view,  the book is good entertainment and does involve the reader emotionally.  But it can be threatening if taken as a theological treatise...there are rules and Absolute Truth, despite what Mr. Young writes. The message that in spite of evil, God loves us and is with us is well-appreciated and faith based.  Mr. Young's presentation of Trinity I recall was very good - three distinct persons yet ONE God.    I remember at the time dissecting the book in a Diocesan group discussion - one of the resources used was this: https://www.osv.com/OSVNewsweekly/Story/TabId/2672/ArtMID/13567/ArticleID/10399/What%E2%80%99s-in-The-Shack.aspx  I think the insistence on referring to God as "She" or anything else is rather silly and merely politically correct.  I have no problem thinking of God in terms of "Father" - I am secure enough in who I am to know that God loves me as I am.

eng_test_5328	"To be eligible for Canadian citizenship, you must have been physically present in Canada as a permanent resident for at least 1,460 days (4 years) in the six years immediately before the date of your application" Sounds simple except the CBSA makes no record of exit. We have no idea who is here or somewhere else. The RCMP investigate numerous fraudulent citizenship applications and citizenship grants supported by fraudulent documents. It's almost an industry run by immigration "consultants". The system is as full of holes as swiss cheese.
eng_test_5329	Trudeau is playing a risky game with the CA-US relationship, between poking the big bear with virtue signaling (immigration and climate change) and now intelligence and security risks.  Swinging with Ivanka and Jarrod is not a sound strategy to make up for other areas of conflict with our largest trading partner.

eng_test_5333	... given the consequences of climate change, and the non-trivial chances that we're an agent causing it, then the mitigation strategies suddenly seem prudent.   Again, we come back to why we wouldn't. It's expensive and disruptive. Sure. But ... scientifically, there's no known natural explanation that explains the observed warming.  Orbital patterns suggest a slight cooling pattern, if anything. Sunspot related solar cycles don't come even close. It keeps coming down to some sort of atmospheric perturbation... of which the most obvious is human emissions.   That's where the "denial" comes in. The counter argument seems to be that since it's not irrefutable, it is probably wrong. It's not, and discarding the body of evidence because it's not irrefutable, is essentially, "denial".   Science is about establishing the best model that explains observations. The best model is, right now, is human climate change. You're welcome to provide a better one, but nobody has been able to.
eng_test_5334	I suppose curiousgeorge that you believe the letter written by the economists that Wynne and company are touting as proof positive the increase is a good thing.  However here is the background on those 53 "economists". http://www.torontosun.com/2017/07/16/minimum-wage-hike-proposal-out-of-touch Or since this doesn't fit  with you thoughts you will dismiss these facts out of hand.  Are you related to Wynne or someone in the liberal gov't because that is how their mind works.  They don't let facts get in their way either.

eng_test_5338	“The longer-term goal of ISIS is to let the United States eat itself from the inside — just let it happen,” he said.  Interesting, ISIS has the same strategy as Russia does.  What they all don't know is that Super Trump knows more about fighting terrorists than all the generals combined.  Ha!
eng_test_5339	First, an MBA program needs GMAT, not SAT scores. Second, he transferred from Fordham University. Here is the link:-  http://fortune.com/2015/08/14/donald-trump-wharton/  The article also mentions that he doesn't release his school records, though he has claimed to be an Honours student (though his name wasn't there on the honours list). It also says he lied about being first in his class.  Political Fact checkers have found that 75 percent of his statements during the campaign were lies. I doubt Trudeau could get anywhere close.  Trump never went bankrupt - true. So why doesn't he release his taxes, like all candidates have for the last 40 years?
eng_test_5340	I think that this is a poorly worded poll, with trick alternatives. How about: D. No.  They are safe from danger and are well-fed and cared for.  It has many advantages over being food prey to sharks and humans, and subject to disease and starvation. * I wonder if the protestors would like to be plunked down in a jungle somewhere with a loin cloth and a bow and arrow, so they could be free to live out their natural lives?
eng_test_5341	According to the author of the article "As a board member, Aaberg pushed the idea of leasing the right for fishing lodges to take boats on the Iliamna River. The village owned 80 percent of it, but a couple of dozen lodges were crowding it with sportfishing clients. The corporation limited use to three boats a day and made the lodges bid for that privilege."
eng_test_5342	This dreadful bombast from our president is meant entirely for US consumption. Trump doesn't get much of anything substantial done, but he works nearly 24/7 on shoring up his support among his base, in case he survives in office until the 2020 election. His base are a bunch of tough-talking yahoos, we saw them in action at his rallies, sucker-punching black people, yelling the "F" word nonstop. screaming "Lock her up!" in stupid unison, cursing Muslim people. Trump is absolutely shameless.  What about the rest of the world? This was a speech at the United Nations, after all. Trump alarmed every thoughtful person, meaning people who want to avoid nuclear war; and that includes the Japanese, threatened by North Korea's dictator. Japan doesn't want a nuclear war, having already been the victim of one.  What happened to diplomacy? Trump's base don't like diplomacy, they want to bomb North Korea back to the stone age, and they don't care about the assured collateral damage to our allies.
eng_test_5343	Come on. Don't be naive. I'm certainly not giving bush praise.  I would consider him economically better than obama hands down but still an incompetent bonehead, no doubt.  Obama not only added more debt than every previous president combined, he also was the only president to not hit 3% GDP growth over 8 years, pathetic really. Obama was also supposed to be the African American saviour. Not the case at all. He created more poverty,  more divisiveness and more reliability on welfare and food stamps. The tech bubble was the first massive fault of the us economy in this era. How about clintons Wall Street deregulation fiasco especially in the case of derivatives. You must of forgot about this little disaster that I think ultimately caused the banking crisis' since. How about gutting manufacturing via trade agreements. War on drugs expansion? The list of bill clintons failures were endless. Don't give me prosperity BS. Also don't spit links from Wikipedia. I could go edit it all.
eng_test_5344	You should try reading ALL of her speech. And WHO she was making her speech to. Or do you only pay attention to context with speakers you agree with?
eng_test_5345	Christina: That is a very good question, whether the universe in unfolding the way it is supposed to. I suspect there are as many answers to that question as there are people on earth.  Here is a tip for a book to help in your quest of the right answer: The Little Prince. St. Exupery (1943). A pilot lands in the Saraha where he encounters the Little Prince, who acts as his guide through earthly questions. Beautifully illustrated. Cheap from Amazon.

eng_test_5347	Who is the moderator what news station does he come from!!! Ask your candidate Kirk Caldwell he knows what he is doing
eng_test_5348	you are correct. Of course all unfair trade practices should be on the table at the same time.  Not negotiated piecemeal.  It is long overdue that supply management, tariffs and subsidies on both sides of the border are killed off.  That is the nature of fair trade - producers face the same shared market and compete equally, not with government leaning on the scales.
eng_test_5349	I liked (non-sarcastically) reading that Trump is trying to think of ways to keep health insurance for those with prior conditions. That is a good thing. The plan is to have a "good" class of insurance for those that keep their coverage, and a "bad" class for those that want insurance sporadically. It has the same carrot and stick approach as Obamacare to encourage healthy people to pay for insurance.   This is what governance is... and it isn't easy. Will everyone that complained about having to pay for expensive insurance while healthy under Obama suddenly think it is a good thing under Trump? As I've said, it is easy to complain and criticize, which is what the right has done for 8 years. Now they have to make tough choices... dump people from healthcare or force healthy people to pay?

eng_test_5352	The canadian middle class is only a shadow of its former self due to the same excess of taxation relative to incomes.  The current millennial generation is the first in a century to be poorer than their parents.  To make matters worse, continuing deficits will make matters worse,as higher taxes in the future will be needed to pay  an ever expanding interest burden.  And, new jobs are mostly low paying service jobs  A populist explosion like seen in the US and elsewhere is inevitable here in Canada.  Tax and Spend must be reversed.  Otherwise, we are doomed to sink further and further downward on the economic totem pole
eng_test_5353	Dragomir  shows why Trump loves the "poorly educated"
eng_test_5354	As someone who has been watching the Broncos for 45 years I find Elways remark disgusting. Yes people's beliefs are their beliefs but you never disrespect the flag. His stance is beyond the pale. Goodbye Broncos, good riddance.
eng_test_5355	The federal law that *might* apply is called "theft of honest services".  It was used successfully in NY to indict, prosecute and convict the state Senate leader and the leader of the state House of Representatives in separate cases.
eng_test_5356	While the act has been amended since then, the original act of 1920 Sec. 207 clearly said: "The commission is authorized to lease to native Hawaiians the right to use and occupancy of a tract of Hawaiian homelands within the following acreage limits: (1) Not less than twenty nor more than eighty acres of agricultural lands; or (2) Not less than one hundred nor more than five hundred acres of first-class pastoral lands; or (3) Not less than two hundred and fifty nor more than one thousand acres of second-class pastoral lands".  Does that sound like a "buy Tutu a condo in Kona" program? Now almost a hundred years later the Polynesian-Hawaiian race has not "died"(in fact it is the fastest growing race in the U.S.), and the "Rehabilitation Act" as it was commonly called at the time, has gone so far a field from its original intent that it has reached a point that it cannot be realistically implemented.

eng_test_5366	Marvelous reflection, Michael.  The article is 100* better than the title.   It's of course far more than about 'feeling', as your article correctly points out, it's about contemplating with the mind, the memory, the imagination, and the will.  Putting our whole self into the Passion, slowly, calmly, with or without feeling.     Thank you, good material for the morning prayer.
eng_test_5367	Krugman, your only claim to fame is economics.  You have nothing to comment about economics so you call Trump a racist.  That's a charge that has no clear or simple defense.  Of course Trump would say he is not racist.  You say he is.  You have proof that Trump would discriminate based on race?  No of course not.  You might pump up some quotes which you interpret to mean whatever tickles you, but others may interpret the same things differently.  More importantly, you as a big name journalist could actually call Trump up and ask him to clarify.  But you would never do that because you like the ambiguity of words taken out of context as long as they turn your crank.  Down with the media.
eng_test_5368	When I joined I joined to protect the Constitution.  I never agreed with Vietnam.  I never agreed with our covert operations in the middle east.  I never agreed with Desert Storm (which happened when I served).  But, I still served for my Constitution.  Not everyone is gung-ho on these wars.  And, simply because some troop thinks the war is necessary doesn't mean it is.  Not one of these "opponents" we've fought have been a true threat to our sovereignty.  Not one.
eng_test_5369	Interesting...so its the RCMP that is spying on citizens illegally then, thus breaking the Charter of Rights, and illegally attempting to: intimidate and create the climate of fear among citizens. Interesting. I'm looking forward to see the lawsuits in the future against these overpaid and over funded agencies, that are often sued. Every Canadian that is a victim of this "mass surveillance" should sue for multi-million dollar suits.
eng_test_5370	Ah, yes, the same ethics commissioner caught lying in her defense of Trudeau's conflict of interest with the Trudeau Foundation and all the money  pouring into the Foundation since his election.   Well, we know what the outcome of this investigation will be don't we?

The first step is to enforce the laws already on the books. I think this program is a good idea but not a practical one. $75,000 won't pay the salary of a single social worker.

Lacking public use facilities it essentially benefits only the residents of Tanana and the local corporation at the expense of the rest of us.

eng_test_5386	Chaput?  He's old and trust, the kind of old man who yells about kids' bicycles on the lawn. He's wanted the red beanie more than anything, has turned cartwheels to try to curry favor. Thing is, he has always leaned far in obvious ways toward those who like him, serve him... there are legions he does not like, does not serve. He is not a man of the people. Not even close.  I think all the holy fathers have seen the lumber in Chaput's eye and thereby passed him over for beanie many many times now.
eng_test_5387	You are correct about what is, but I was speaking of what ought to be. Implying that people who are opposed to keeping the Electoral College simply don't understand it is literally no different from implying that pro-lifers oppose abortion because they simply don't understand what it is. Such implications are straw-man provocations that only serve to harass one's political opponents and coarsen civil debate.

eng_test_5389	The good old days were pretty sweet. That said, if I have a choice, then it's Alaska Airlines. They have done some nice improvements over the last few years for those of us in coach class. Granted, the meals could be better, but the crew, and flight attendants are gracious and polite. Much better than Delta, or United have ever been to us. Our last trip with them was from NYC, to Anchorage. We flew back with two puppies that we adopted from the Caribbean. Since they were in the same carrier, they only charged for one, and gave us seats that gave more legroom so their kennel would fit better. Great people.

eng_test_5392	She isn't going to stop growth and density - even if she wanted to, and there's no evidence of that, she's just one of nine.  Even if you aren't sure she's right about everything, the political makeup of the council is so uniform right now that it would be healthy to have one person who represents a large part of the rest of Seattle.  I don't know what you saw in Nelson, but Murakami is a small business owner too, and I think she'd be an excellent advocate for that group. All we get from Gonzalez is politically correct resolutions.

eng_test_5397	Seeking a weekend break from his campaign rallies, Donald Trump jetted to his yacht, which was docked off the coast of Italy. He invited Pope Francis and the press corps on board for a Saturday afternoon cruise. It was a rather windy day. The Pope's little hat, his zucchetto, was blown from his head and into the water. A crewman began lowering a boat to retrieve the zucchetto. Trump told the crewman not to bother. Trump climbed down the yacht's ladder; walked across the waves, picked up the zucchetto; walked back to the yacht and handed it to the Pope. The Pope and the press corps were amazed! Donald Trump could actually walk on water! Speculation immediately began as to how ABC, CNN, NBC, The Washington Post and New York Times would report this miraculous event to the rest of the world. The next morning the New York Times headline read . . . . Donald Trump Can't Swim
eng_test_5398	Excellent summary and plan moving forward. By the way, given a choice, I'd rather watch a game at Aloha Stadium than any of the stadiums listed. If the stadium is be upgraded or rebuilt, I hope they ask for guidance from the President or someone with similar building experience. (sadly I'm not joking. It is criminal to have the citizens of Hawaii be financially responsible  for the rail project; the more over budget, the more the supporters benefit. The citizens have no recourse, thanks to a one-party government.
eng_test_5399	Let's just look at the tax increases from Socialist Notley. 1. Top marginal personal provincial rate from 10% to 15%. A 50% increase! 2. Corporate provincial tax rate from 10% to 12%. A 20% increase! 3. Income taxes on dividends from 19% to 31%. A 63% increase! (provincial and federal) 4. Carbon tax implemented. This is one good political move she did make by calling a quasi sales tax a carbon tax. I strongly disagree with the tax however, no matter what it is called. Irrespective of who did what, prior to Socialist Notley, with the tax grabs above, you would think that we would be saving money again and having surpluses. With a "projected" deficit of $71,000,000,000 Billion by the next election. The actual will probably be closer to $85,000,000,000 Billion. I sincerely hope that we as Albertans have learned what the cost of socialism and NDP truly is. It has cost us lost businesses, human talent and the financial flexibility to grow our province.
eng_test_5400	There's a difference between confidence and overagressiveness brought on by insecurity. Trump is a childish authoritarian with a fragile ego. He goes a wee bit irrational over things like his alleged small hands and the sparse attendance at his inauguration.  His unhinged tweets are how he releases his tension and insecurity.   How much do you think it bothers him that Melania pushed his hand away?  Answer:  a lot.  He prides himself on dating and marrying only 10's, and on being in control of the situation. Expect some interesting tweets soon---or more awkward behavior.
eng_test_5401	You're correct that this is about fine tuning and that's why this guy should be on the committee.  Advance requests need to be carefully defined with sufficient safeguards.

What is the risk of oxybenzone to reef health as opposed to, say, sewage, glyphosate, all those pharmaceutical drugs we wash down the sink and toilet every day, and the warming of the oceans as impacted by everyone driving vehicles and eating industrial meats?  My general sense is that this is a low-hanging fruit with real, but small impacts on reef health.
eng_test_5408	Trumpers?? Shake of head. You ripped Christie apart for punishing a representative with Bridgegate and now you want to "Bridgegate" a whole state?  Kindly start your morning by looking in the mirror and saying, "America First' like Trump says.  You do know that that makes Trump 2nd?

eng_test_5411	Brad12, investigations into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia have been ongoing since July 2016 and have been or are still being conducted by the FBI, CIA, NSA, several Congressional committees, and since March 2017, by Special Prosecutor Mueller.  Despite 15 months of investigating, not a single piece of evidence has been produced to support the allegations, yet you blindly accept the unproven allegations as fact.  I will believe when I see incontrovertible evidence.

Everyone always jumps on the state employees in general - It's the state's DEPARTMENTS that we should investigate. Stop and think of the welfare  'give away' programs going to folks who to believe they're entitled. Particularly, programs that supporting a single parent who continues to have one child after another; increasing  monthly checks from all programs! It's disgraceful we allow such practices. I strongly suspect folks are double dipping, and using multiple services for which they don't qualify. Walker could do something for this state if he tore into the core of our welfare system. Most of the system administrators just out wait the new governors, and continue on with what they're doing year after year...

eng_test_5425	She is right in stating the causation of climate change not being proven one way or another. Interesting SA had an article 'Predatory journals publish dubious work' yesterday that points to scholarly maleficence. There are many weak points in the global warming alarmists postulation/projections (i.e. CO2 and  air temperature are not connected as much as water vapor and air temperature are), and thankfully to date, most of those dire predictions have NOT come true. It is simply not a settled science or, our TV weathermen would be right more than 20% of the time. The earth's temperature is rising and our oceans are by far the biggest contributor to global CO2 and water vapor. On that we all agree, the rest is accepted by your worldview... Again, she was right.

eng_test_5440	The professor spreads one of Canada's enduring myths when he claims:   "And above all, its immigration policy is tolerant and open-minded, making for the truly multicultural polity that provokes the world’s envy."  Wrong.  The fact that our "immigration policy is tolerant and open-minded" has NOTHING to do with Canada's success in assembling a PEACEFUL mix of diverse peoples. Canada's success in assembling a peaceful, low-crime mix DOES have to do with its immigration policy, but not in the way that the professor pretends.  Canada is peaceful because, unlike many countries, Canada for decades has had a powerful filter in its immigration machinery. And that filter is there to ensure we mostly receive very intelligent, well educated families, where the daddy and/or mommy from overseas is a doctor, a scientist, a pharmacist, an engineer.  Much about intelligence is genetic, and kids of smart parents tend to address problems without violence. That is the REAL reason why we have peace.

eng_test_5457	Why would anyone trust what the RE industry is saying?  - Around 7 months ago they were still telling us that prices would never drop. "It's Toronto, we are different". - They were saying that you needed to buy NOW, or forever be left out.  - Telling us that inventory would always be low, not enough houses.  - Telling us that interest rates would never go up.   And here we are, detached homes in Toronto are down around -24% in a few months, I call that the start of a crash! Lots of inventory (more to come). Buyers are gone!  Interest have gone up twice (more to come). And B20 legislation that will force 2% stress test on uninsured mortgages.  Lets not forget that Canadians are the most indebted in the industrialized World!  PS: TREB has just stopped publishing mid-month stats on GTA market! Market is going down.
eng_test_5458	A government intervention is/was needed.  Canadian residents need to be able to afford to buy or rent a place to live.  Foreign capital used to monoplize housing in Canada should not be allowed.  What was going on in the GTA housing market was a market failure; something had to be done.  Now, what is a reasonable price for a house in 2017? Would a 4 - 6% year-over-year price increase be considered reasonable? If that is the case, if one pays about 80% over the 2005 sale prices or about 60% over 2007, that should be ok. Paying for a property that has increased in value much more than those percentage increases would be too much and bound to fall either in the short-term or plateau in the long term.  https://twitter.com/MukHomam/status/851805647297548288

eng_test_5462	Trump has come to represent the worst aspects of autocratic politics. There is not one redeeming value to his ideology. Greed is of the essence of his world view. He expresses "patriotism" by calling for tanks in his inauguration parade and stating that his inauguration should be a “national day of patriotic devotion."  He expresses "democracy" by launching a phony voter fraud commission and calling for prosecution of journalists. He expresses "government of the people" by lying to a tiny slice of gullible, ill informed voters, then ignoring them when he gets into office. Trump says the nation is divided but is so self consumed, he does not realize he's the source of those divisions.

The 7 rules are a good guide for how people should behave in daily situations, but they don't provide a direction for life, and certainly they don't provide a direction for someone in high political office.

eng_test_5519	One solution of labor cost avoidance of large businesses is for the State legislature to adopt a "Public Assistance Service Surcharge" (PASS) Recovery Tax.  Businesses would avoid this PASS Recovery Tax in two ways,  1. pay a living wage that raises employees above the threshold for Public Assistance eligibility; and / or 2. provide employees a 40 hour full time position at a living wage.  If a businesses chooses to do neither, the PASS Recovery Tax on the business would be the aggregate gross amount of Public Assistance benefits for the business's employee(s) paid by the government (taxpayers), plus a 3% interest charge on the gross amount.  Or, if the business chooses to pay a living wage and sufficient hours for its employees, and thus not eligible for Public Assistance, then the business would receive (as is the cost deduction is anyway) a 100% cost of business deduction for labor costs, plus a 5% tax credit applied to business's tax debt.

When medical providers have to treat the uninsured they raise prices on those who have insurance to make up for the lost revenue.  It's called cost shifting. Fewer uninsured people means less cost shifting, and less money that I have to pay to cover them.  If you don't realize that, you don't understand health insurance at all.

eng_test_5529	This column is based on the opinion of one 'expert'. So it seems to be rather one-sided. Other studies and experts have spoken about speculation and foreign money particularly. They've also mentioned development in Toronto has yet to brush up against these green-belts - which means we have more land to develop.   Given the fact only the real-estate industry has spoken about the supply side of things, it made me curious to find out more about the Frontier Centre for Public Policy. Their website says it "neither seeks nor accepts any government funding whatsoever. Instead, we seek to diversify our funding base as much as possible to ensure that we are not beholden to any particular industry, interest or persons."   This statement isn't enough. To be taken more seriously,  the Centre needs to provide more details on where they get their funding from. I wouldn't be surprised to find developers and the real estate industry among their donors.

Self governance is messy. Requires voices to be heard, opinions to be expressed. Simply put debate among the self governed.

Then wait and ride another feeder bus.  1.5-2 hours for a 20 mile commute that used to take 45 minutes via express bus.  In that travel time, I could probably commute from Maryland to DC.  Apples to oranges.  It's not the traffic that will cause the long travel times but the inefficiencies of the $10 billion REPLACEMENT system.
eng_test_5538	Sorry, I don't get it. 50 years ago was 1967 and the start of a cultural revolution led by pot-smoking, 20-somethings and rock n' roll bands.
eng_test_5539	The library is definitely part of downtown.
eng_test_5540	The Great Trumpkin.
eng_test_5541	You say that, "There is no place in Alaska where the wolf population has been eradicated. " Several years ago I was told by a well-known trapper in Mat-Su that all the wolves got trapped out of the Knik and trappers have to go to all the way to Glennallen. I don't know whether the wolf population in the Knik has recovered since.
eng_test_5542	You know all the liberal are in lock step when all I heard was its a dark speech by all the left pundits and politicians.  They had a planned narrative ready to go no matter what he said.
eng_test_5543	Dodge Grand Caravan had terrible transmissions as well....  been there done that! Speaking from experience, all I know is I've had bad luck with two Dodge's and good luck with Honda. The links provided might be accurate or they're paid testimonials to pump up Dodge? (who is always 3-6 months from bankruptcy?)...
eng_test_5544	And this pie is way ,way up in the sky.
eng_test_5545	"cheese-free queso"...or cheese-free cheese in non-hip language.  That goes perfectly with meat-free carnitas, egg-free huevos, and wheat/corn-free tortilla. Wash it down with milk-free leche. So delicious must be...
eng_test_5546	stop! no common sense allowed here.
eng_test_5547	The only country in the western world that doesn't provide essential health care to the poor and working class. Highest cause of bankruptcies in the U.S. is due to health care expenses. This affects Americans from many social classes and is unique to that very wealthy country.
eng_test_5548	Oh, and by the way, Stockton still made its CalPers payments even in bankruptcy.  Any more ideas?
eng_test_5549	No no no no no you don't my dear.    I did not like your writing in this part.  You said:  The progressive income tax based on federal tax liability would apply to people in higher income levels and exempt or minimize the impact on those in lower income levels. The income tax would capture income earned in Alaska by non-residents, and state income taxes can be a deductible item for someone filing a federal income tax return.  You talk of fairness and then you talk of exempting people.  Sorry my dear but a fair tax is not making some pay and others exempt.  how do you call that fair?  This is the reason I never ever agreed with liberal or democratic concepts, you make some pay and exempt everyone else.
eng_test_5550	Guess what? The 31-page indictment of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates makes no mention of Trump or Russia or “collusion.” The media seemed as dejected as a kid who wakes up on Christmas morning, only to find there are no presents under the tree. Gee whiz.
eng_test_5551	Anybody remember when the canoe caught Mahi "lips"?  Trolling "too fast". The escort vessel Mio Tai kept the lips in their freezer.

eng_test_5556	Clintons e-mails where released and reviewed by the FBI and WikiLeaks not once but twice because Comey made a big commotion over the same e-mails he'd already investigated. Pence used a personal server for e-mails while Governor of Indiana. Trump used an Unsecure phone in WH. But that's always a different story.
eng_test_5557	So finally we get the truth, which most people knew anyway! Illegals paying sales tax is a poor argument for "illegals pay taxes"!
eng_test_5558	You are dreaming with your comment that a tax on foreigners will push prices to a much lower new equilibrium.  Vancouver house prices are up about four percent from a year ago, and we are about half a year in from the introduction of the foreign buyer tax. Read about it in today's news report, "Canadian new home prices rise in January".  Sorry, there was no lurch to a much lower new equilibrium. House prices still cost dozens of times the average annual local income.
eng_test_5559	So you want Texas to become a cesspool like ALL areas controlled by democrats. How intolerant of you
eng_test_5560	Who doesn't need to pay for healthcare? Is that like bankrobbers don't need to pay for banking?
eng_test_5561	Correct me if I'm wrong, CU has historically recruited in California, so joining the conference that includes the state of California makes sense. And you can't forget the power of those TV contracts. CU had to follow TV money and the millions of screens in the West Coast. TV owns a majority of college sports and dictates what conferences schools want to join.
eng_test_5562	I guess it to early to tell if the mortgages are at risk. Oaken Bank pays very good interest 1.75% on a HISAs.  If you have spare cash it is (was) a great place to park it.  Home Capital allegedly lied (provided alternate facts if you use Trumpism's) about certain mortgages with respect to the ability of the borrower and misled investors. Now people with cash (certainly anything over $100,000) are withdrawing their funds drying up capital, eventually HC will not be able to cover the withdrawals hence the need for a loan (at >20%). If their GIC's, which also pay a very good rate (2.25% 2 yr) take a hit it is toast.  It is essentially a panic attack from the Bank customers wanting their cash back. Meanwhile other banks are taking a hit so it is a good time to buy those bank stocks you'v been looking at.
eng_test_5563	Sure, right after he releases those tax returns.  Have we not figured out yet that the rules don't apply to him, that his constituents don't care, at least not yet.
eng_test_5564	I agree with removing tax breaks for religious bodies except for their actual charitable work. However that would have zero affect on extremism, many guys who go into terrorism have already been tossed from mosques because they were too extreme and intolerant.
eng_test_5565	We need mandatory retirement! We need to encourage potential retirees to not retire! We need more immigrants to boost the work force! We need to counter ageism that forces people to retire in their 50s!  What we need are fewer useless "experts" who give all sorts of contradictory advice!
eng_test_5566	How does it make sense that every primary spoken language category has had a positive % change from 2011?  Some categories would have to decrease for others to increase.    Same with the % of children living with one parent - how can it be increasing for both fathers AND mothers?  The percent difference would need to be decreasing for one unless they were primarily living with someone else in 2011.
eng_test_5567	The Troopers are correct:  the concept of banishment, particularly when no court was involved and no legal defense was possible, likely violates the civil rights of those banished.  In the case of a person actually convicted of a crime, depending on technical legal details of local, state and Federal laws, it might be legal.  A review and decision by the Department of Law would be at least a reasonable foundation for Trooper action.   Sympathetic as I am with the motives of the Village Council members, I suspect due process is not being honored.  It is rare for legal action to be permitted in the absence of a hearing or the right to a defense.
eng_test_5568	This happened near Springfield?
eng_test_5569	Paul, you and I both know that President Obama could easily have won reelection.
eng_test_5570	Associated Press news feed.  So much obstructionism and intent to get in the way of what needs to be done.
eng_test_5571	$3.2 billion would earn us around $250 million each year.  So when we spend it, we also kill the earnings it would have yielded every year.  $100 per second.  Every second of every day.
eng_test_5572	It is good to see one of our Courageous Bishops using the civil bankruptcy system to protect the assets of the One True Church.  Particularly heartwarming was the claim that one of the factors favoring bankruptcy was to compensate victims.  Only divine inspiration could inspire a Bishop to make such a statement.  In this time of Lent, the action and the explanation are truly inspiring and should bring many people back to the Church.
eng_test_5573	If I had one middle finger for every gender I'd have....oh wait I already do.
eng_test_5574	I am not so sure, if you look at the country it is so heavily polarized and the two sides seem to live in different worlds so I suspect like on pretty much every issue nowadays GOP supporters will think its great, Democrat supporters will be outraged.  Lets remember most Americans only associate with those with similar views, only listen, watch, and read what confirms to their pre-conceived bias so those thinking this will change public opinion dramatically I wouldn't be so sure.
eng_test_5575	RA:  Perhaps if you looked at your comment that evoked a nasty reply you would see a correlation.  Not that it makes it any better but it seems to me that most "nasty" replies directed at you are the result of a "nasty" comment you made earlier.  Again, not content so much as tone.  The degree to which someone finds something offensive on any level is influenced by that individual's experience or judgement.  Some people are more sensitive than others, sometimes in a good way, sometimes not.

eng_test_5579	Airline passengers got exactly what they asked for when they demanded cheap flights, they got cheap flights. Why complain about not getting goods and services you didn't pay for? It's like expecting a Rolls Royce when all you ordered and paid for was a Ford Focus.
eng_test_5580	Yes, I want the OLF shut down. Never denied that for the last 4 years. That’s exactly what I want. And the Growlers moved elsewhere. That is what I want. No surprise.
eng_test_5581	"You need to identify the budgets and the cuts before you have the right to go ahead and ask for more taxes."  Identify the budgets and cuts? Nobody in legislative history uses more words to say absolutely nothing than the average Mat-Su conservative legislator. With this quote Eastman identified himself as just another of the Mat-Su's endless string of mindless conservative ideologues.
eng_test_5582	Don't be too impressed with Francis Sullivan, all he's done is state the obvious. I attended a Spirituality in the Pub session and he just drooled before the faithful as far as I'm concerned until the guy I accompanied  stood up and gave his situation an airing with a few handouts.....no longer had he sat down amid a silence you hear a pin drop,  another took his place. This time a solicitor God bless  him, who had been abused as a child that sent a powerful message for them both across the silent room. More than a coincidence were my thoughts breathing a prayer of gratitude.
eng_test_5583	A retribution replay, please, of Nicolae Ceaușescu's end in 1989, a Christmas present for the Romanian people.
eng_test_5584	I commend these young men for making their statement and for doing so knowing the potential consequences. They are exercising their rights and expressing their feelings which takes strength! We need people willing to make a stand or in their case kneel, in the face of adversity and will certainly need them in the times ahead. These kids weren't burning flags in the street, they weren't causing trouble for anyone, they were making a statement, a clear and rather bold statement. Anyone who thinks kids don't know what's happening right now, that they don't have feelings about this disaster that is left for them to clean up need to think again! They inherit it, heck, try being them and getting this mess handed to you as your future. MOF how dare anyone try to muffle the voices of the youth and at least they are playing football, more than I can say for the lot of you child silencers.
eng_test_5585	That's possible. But pot is illegal, so everyone else who doesn't have a card must go to the street dealer who gets it from illegal growers and Mexico.
eng_test_5586	De mortuis nihil nisi bonum dicendum est.
eng_test_5587	Not so.  It would be Pence's policies, not the man himself, that would determine the opposition.  If he were to try to outlaw abortion, hand Social Security to Wall Street, or gut Medicare, you can be sure there would be furious opposition.  Just like only a mythical "gun-grabbin'" stirs up right wingers.
eng_test_5588	For me I'm wondering if this plan will be like the last one where Obama said, "If you like your health care plan, you can keep it". Oh wait, that turned out not to be true! So weird since Obamacare was such great program. (sarcasm)
eng_test_5589	"Unfortunately, it never ceases to amaze me how voters will elect a party to the White House and then give that president an opposite majority in congress."   Gerrymandering will do that for you.

eng_test_5592	I found it refreshing.
eng_test_5593	And yet three of out the first five comments on this column are from you.  Just get it over with and ask Southey out. She can say no, and you can get on with your life.
eng_test_5594	We'll never know for sure.  But you are correct, price for sf detached started to climb again, after stuttering, coincidentally when restrictions were eased.  Or it could have been that offshore buying would have rebounded anyways, as more buyers used loopholes, or factored the 15% into cost of business.  And price for condos also skyrocketed, coincidentally when the BC Liberals offered financial incentives to buy.  And the quick price trajectory has now more than wiped out those government incentives, which was an outcome predicted by some experts.   In the end though, price has held, and any short lived downturn, was indeed very short lived.
eng_test_5595	Agree. Too many "slow pitch" questions from sociology undergrads.
eng_test_5596	Here we go again.    Until our city council bans ALL fireworks, I'll continue to write to them and roll my eyes at how every 4th of July is regarded here.   It makes no sense that much the legal kind are even allowed.   I just love trying to figure out if something I heard was legal or not.    Of course, the VERY VERY loud ones are all  illegal, but there are times when you just don't know!      As if the legal ones simply self-water themselves immediately after they go off...yea, they could never cause a fire.   Go tell that to my neighbor who had 2 firetrucks arrive in 2009 to knock out a side wall of bricks to make sure the fire damage from legals didn't get too far inside.     Shame on the city council except for Betty Taylor.   What's it going to take for a total ban?   A wildfire, burnt down city building, or school?   Shame on certain churches and other organizations who collect money through the sale of fireworks  aka: incendiary devices.   Pastor Taylor are you listening?
eng_test_5597	These things always come down to the hidden stuff the public doesn't see  Not convinced a peace keeping mission will matter, we should be a shoo-in right now given the global climate.  I expect to win.
eng_test_5598	The work of the MMIW is already over and provided good value for the Liberal Party. It probably secured 1,000,000 votes in 2015, and at $53.80/vote, was a bargain. Now they just need to stretch it out to 2019 and see if they can do it again.
eng_test_5599	Monica:  do they come in appropriate liturgical colors?  Speaking of hoods and sheets:
eng_test_5600	Trump has not yet nominated someone to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane Center.   And the center itself is in the midst of a director search, after its last director, Rick Knabb, left in May
eng_test_5601	Impeach the man, he's ruining our lives and trying to kill us off.
eng_test_5602	Yes, we need electoral reform. Trudeau caught the wind and put it front and centre in his campaign promises - many Canadians who voted for it have just been slapped in the face.  The fact that Trudeau has a majority must also be connected to his promises for "change" to the electoral voting system.
eng_test_5603	This misses the point so much. If you care so much about women who wear the niqab/burka being able to freely move/interact/communicate in open society, why don't you acknowledge that the VERY act of covering a woman's face removes them from society.  Facial expression, the moving of the mouth, looking at one's face when speaking to someone is INTEGRAL to basic human communication.  How can women move freely in the world when they are covered?   YOU ARE LITERALLY ERASING A WOMAN'S ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE.   This infantile belief of moral and cultural relativism is going to continue to polarize Canada.  If people can't have an honest conversation about conservative Islam then all the problems you just described in this article will only get worse.  ALL conservative religion is oppressive to women, and you're doing no favours to your community by defending this bullshit.

eng_test_5609	Does it matter how often someone posts? Just don't read them then, no big deal.   . The valid issue @Layla4 raised, was can a poster have their comments removed if enough people - or one person with different handles - flag a comment.  Can that person then be suspended from posting. Does the G+M moderator even intervene, or is this just a system response.  Btw I know plenty of people who have no interest in following politics, no interest in ever reading about issues, let alone posting about them. They are content without a voice. unless of course something happens that affects them personally. Usually in their wallet. And they would look askance at you or I posting even once.  I would much rather the engaged voice of the concerned, regardless of how many times that voice speaks out.

eng_test_5619	By then, the City Councilors  who granted the MUPTE will no longer be in office.  Their successors will merely wring their hands and say "I just don't know what they were thinking!"

eng_test_5634	You are correct, Skinut, you did not say form was more important than substance, but you implied it by focusing on how Trump appeared.  Actions are more important than how he appeared.  Judge him by how the Federal government response to the crisis and not by the cap he wears or the shoes Melania may wear.  After all, he is ultimately responsible for everything it does or fails to do.  Up to now the Federal government under Trump leadership deserves an A+ responding to the Harvey disaster.

eng_test_5647	Nice.
eng_test_5648	Here's some help.  First, it's interesting that you didn't recognize that my use of "in the most charitable way" was love!!  Please learn the distinctions between three sets of 'strengths'  1. Fruits of the Holy Spirit (love, joy, patience, kindness) 2. Human or cardinal virtues: prudence, justice, temperance, & fortitude. 3.Theological virtues:  Faith, Hope, and Charity.  Fruits..are given to us by God by our union with Him.  Human virtues are acquirable through practice.  Theological virtues are 'infused' in us.  We can't make our own.  We need to ask God for more of each.   Our desire for closer union with God through the infusion of those virtues.  Each gives us closer union in a different way.   Have you ever read St Thomas Aquinas's work on the virtues?  He profoundly related and linked the "virtue work" of the Greeks with the theological virtues.  He showed how the human virtues at their most perfect state dispose us to full use of the Theological virtues.   A complementary fit.

Liberals are doing a simply smashing job of solving this crisis but, then, this is pretty typical as to how liberals approach problems - throw tons of money at it with no accountability and when it all falls apart, such as their "solutions" for homelessness, blame a supposed lack of money and spend more.  And Democrats wonder why they can't win elections.
eng_test_5664	Joanna777 claims the money as hers. I wonder what she did that makes the money hers. Same goes for all against using PF earnings for government. John Tepton is correct. The PF was indeed put in place to be a "rainy day fund."

eng_test_5670	I met her while I was doing  some work out at Hiland about 15 years ago.  At that time her story was that her ex-husband was to blame.  Apparently he was a trooper or cop out in the Valley.  She was convinced that he was sabotaging her at every turn and working to try to turn the boys against her.  I don't know if she's guilty or not, but she shared information with me totally out of context and there was nothing in the conversations that I recall about the accelerant theory being wrong.  It was all about her ex, then.  Later I saw the Frontline program.  There are enough questions and uncertainty that this deserves a second look.

eng_test_5673	I'm not a big fan of either, but I've seen both, if you can count the first three Star Wars movies and a random smattering of different Star Trek episodes as having seen them.   Of course you have an apples and oranges problem in making the comparison, because the scope of the two projects – objectives, budgets, people involved, and all things creative – were so different. Trek was conceived to sell ads on network TV, right? Wars was a Lucas/Spielburg extravaganza. Sure, Trek became a series of movies too, but that was afterthought. So it bothers me that you cite history based on the movies with Star Wars first, when Star Trek actually started almost two decades earlier than Star Wars, in 1966, as a television show.   Production values, star power, effects, of course all go to Star Wars, and there is budget and objectives behind that. But Star Trek did start earlier, paved the way, and had a long history of different people involved, with an interesting flair for putting real human problems (racism, for example, a recurring theme in Star Trek as the different races dealt with each other) into a new perspective. And there's interesting comparisons on the big picture, too ... the great Yoda perspective and quotes, of course, and the whole power of the force, in Star Wars. But Trek embraced big picture too, like the larger collective metaphor of Seven of Nine.   I wish you'd done a straight compare and contrast, instead of which is better. Better will always be subjective, and it's too close ended, in my opinion.

Then they pat themselves on the back, sing "Hawaii Aloha",  and go  home to plan their next "fact finding" vacations.

eng_test_5683	The Emmerson Reeve made the best case as to what should happen with the current influx of refugee claimants crossing into Canada, that they check in at a border crossing. The current system of just walk across and we will pick you, is hardly a sign of a government that has such high aspirations, and then behaves like a third world country. Goodale is a little bit disingenuous when he says that crossing this way is not a free ticket to Canada , as border services outlines who gets to stay and who doesn't and very few are  transported out of Canada. Related to this are the thousands of people who have been slated to be deported from Canada, but can't be found. Again Border services are very forthcoming with this information. The Liberals apparently prefer to just let the whole thing stay as it is, and hope no one notices.

eng_test_5686	$250,000 house is easy to find in the metro area, even in this hot real estate market.  If you can get the 20% down ($50,000) the current 30 year mortgage would be around $950/month or $11,400/year.   Of course your property taxes in Eugene on that sort of house are likely to run around $3700/year or $308/month so the taxes might tip the balance between what's affordable and what isn't.

Nobody knows what Donald Trump would do with any degree of certainty because Donald Trump is all over the map on every issue." (AL.com. 2/29/16)

The crew was less subject to this as they had a better mix of fresh air and exhaust.  Many of us complained and asked that the door be closed as as passengers were all on board.  The flight attendant actually said to several passengers sitting at the front of the seating area, "Well you can get off the plane and find another flight if you want, but we are not closing the door."....in a tone that clearly communicated that they did not care.  My solution, stop flying Combi planes when and where possible.

eng_test_5710	All three of these recent hantavirus cases occurred in areas with big leaf maple trees. Last fall was a huge season for their spinning seeds, which came down in masses. That wasn't a result of increased rainfall, but probably triggered by the drought instead. Now we have the increased rainfall, which does nothing, here, to increase food supply. That is something that happens in the Southwest U.S., and Duchin keeps thinking that way. To see better information on the local situation, see my site, www.hantasite.com

If Trump starts to cement his image as a conceited ignoramus the world will get scared, and there could be a flight to quality i.e. bonds . "Buy on rumour, sell on fact".

I already responded to your question in the excerpts from other sources I already posted--which I not only provided links to, but also spoon-fed to you in bite-sized chunks. Yet you still complain that everything I've already posted is just a lot of "werds" to you.    Then I tried to over-simplify it even more by asking you to simply copy and paste the werds--from the single source you posted--that you think are "facts."  Yet you continue to insist that I tell you what you perceive as "facts"--as if I am supposed to read your mind.  You can write, so I assumed you can read.  But now I wonder if you even read the op-ed piece YOU posted.  Assuming you have, what is the problem?  After all, I've had other students who needed remedial edu, but they did not deny they needed it like you do.  So, unlike Trump, who admitted health care is more complicated than he thought, are you just too proud to admit that?  No shame, brah!

eng_test_5729	Amazing it took so long to prove the obvious. There are night owls and early birds, and having a schedule that matches your natural rhythm is better for everyone. This is even more pronounced in adolescence.  I am a boomer, not a millennial, but was always a night owl...until my mid-fifties when suddenly my sleep pattern changed and I turned into an early bird, who knows why.   The world is still designed on the pattern of pre-modern, agricultural life, when you had to get up early to feed the animals, etc., and "the early bird gets the worm", and so those lucky enough to be born early risers had the advantage over the night owls. That is no longer necessary. I was so much happier when I got a job with a schedule that fit my natural pattern, after decades of trying to adapt to the "normal" schedule.

eng_test_5734	Comments from a former setnetter and long time dipnetter. First, run timing varies tremendously day-to-day, even tide-to-tide. The fish school up in the rips, then push into the river in pulses. No one knows why they wait, or why they all come at once, but it is glorious if you're there during a big push.  Secondly, saying that "optimal" dipnetting requires 80K to 120K is akin to saying A+ is optimal for GPA. The huge days produce quick limits, but that there are only a handful each year. Counts over 30K are generally sufficient to get your fish if you are competent and persistent, and success increases incrementally as 30K is exceeded.    Third, commercial openings do not necessarily preclude success. This year, 30K was exceeded every day from July 10 to July 18, despite commercial openings on July 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18. Between pulses, there are fewer fish for everyone.   Finally, it's a shared resource, and weekend dippers would benefit from no EOs on Saturdays.

They don't mention that in the press release.  I see lots of talk about how great their ideas are but not a whole lot on how it's going to be paid for. I see a lot of it is just re-branded ACA ideas.  Oh, yeah, I see the usual 'block grants' and 'liability reform' ideas as well. Can't leave those antiques out!   The sad thing is all the time lost playing political games instead of just working in good faith from the get-go. Of course when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said his NUMBER ONE goal was to make Obama a one-term president, we knew how honest Republicans would be working on the nation's problems.

Let's focus on trimming down locks and doors and heat in a house, and instead ignore the larger parts of the home budget with sharply increasing curves of spending.   Good idea.   Got it.
eng_test_5790	Although this incident will likely be shoved to the back page as irrelevant, the bigger danger is it is an indicator of his "shoot from the hip" mentality which is all very fine when you can just look across the desk and say "your fired" but on the world stage, rightly or wrongly, it just doesn't work that way. As an example just look at how things get blown up if someone misquotes a book or is thought to slander it.

eng_test_5793	Was this article reprinted from thirty years ago?  I'm tired of articles that justify bigotry by calling on science when the author is either unwilling or unable to understand the science.  The science here is quite clear. Biology and gender are TWO SEPARATE THINGS. Children and adults that are allowed to explore their gender do very well when they are supported appropriately by those around them. When the opposite happens, which is what this author is advocating, the outcomes are negative, sometimes tragically so.

Trudeau seems to think that running a small business and working for the government are identical and there should be no "unfair" advantage for all the risks and stress involved in starting a business. Why with the Liberals is the focus always on grabbing as much money as possible instead of a sanity check on their out of control spending? Never a comment on wise use of the already exorbitant taxes being extracted from hard working Canadians.

But you don't seriously believe that dogs have killed all the ground squirrels, rabbits and ptarmigan near Anchorage do you? First of all, there never have been rabbits in the Chugach foothills. Those are snowshoe hares, which have huge natural population fluctuations. Ptarmigan also cycle naturally. Ground squirrels have never been abundant in the front range, in my experience, and of course they hibernate for 6 months a year. All three species are still there.  You do realize that many dogs nowadays aren't much bigger than a cat? And most cats I know can back down a dog. Do you see lots of stray dogs in Anchorage? I don't, probably because most people obey the leash law, at least when they are around other people and pets. And Anchorage Animal Control actually picks up roaming dogs and at least some owners are fined. Anchorage doesn't even have a person assigned to pick up cats.

And insulting people who commute to Toronto by claiming they aren't paying their share of taxes there because they don't live there is nonsense. People aren't driving around Toronto in rush hour for the fun of it. No, theyre driving to and from businesses that employ them. Those businesses pay property taxes which is in turn meant to be used responsibly by government, part of which is meant to be maintenance of roads. Get your spending in order before you go claiming the people who come from outside the city to work at businesses that pay their property taxes aren't doing their bit.

eng_test_5852	"Yes, he should have, but alcohol impairs judgment. My understanding was that they were all drunk - the girlfriend, the current boyfriend and the ex."  To be fair, we discussed whether it was even a good idea long before we actually went out, while we were stone, cold sober. We both came to the conclusion we were adult enough to handle him and any potential flirting he might do, seeing as it was a group situation, in public.  But, alcohol being what it is, she flirted back with him and intentionally pitted us against each other, and then he got possessive.  Yeah, I should have just walked out right then, but he was a little creepy, her friends were scared of him, and I thought the better solution was to stick this one night out, get her home safe and sound, and then walk away when everyone was sobered up.

eng_test_5863	Well stated.  Another thing I think we should ask Commissioners Thompson and Burnett:  What do your athletes major in?  Do they major in physical education, which isn't a very demanding major?  Or do they major in math, hard sciences, or computer science, curriculums which require a lot of lab work in addition to what the students do in class?  A lot of athletes, because of the time they spend on the practice field and playing games, will select easier courses of study so they can better balance sports and academics.  Plus, Commissioners, what is the overall graduation rate at the schools in your conferences?  If the overall graduation rate is something like 70 percent while the graduation rate for athletes is 20 percent, then you ought to be concerned.

eng_test_5865	I would welcome an informative article by the RG on other types of government, and how a strong mayor and city council type would work compared to Eugene's strong but unelected City Manager and weak electeds. Do cities with under 200,000 population live well under a strong mayor and city council? Too much is done in secret in Eugene's type of government, but maybe it is the best available? Most likely it is cheaper to have a part time council and mayor. Hugh Massengill, Eugene Oregon

It was in the regions of Quebec not Montreal where the niqab was an issue that hurt the NDP and the Liberals have always been weak there.  Also much of the NDP support in 2011 were soft nationalist whereas most Liberal voters in Quebec are staunch federalist thus a different voting pool.
eng_test_5872	My guess is that the jury is still out on whether Trump's presidency is valid, given the questions raised in the mainstream press about pre-election contacts between Putin's and Trump's staffs.  And then there is the question of Trump's possible financial ties to Russia.  So no, I don't think even political legitimacy is certain, but I'm not sure if there is a mechanism in American government to address this.  Yes, very left progressives looked to Russia, especially in the '30s, but many became disenchanted.   What confuses me is, wasn't it always the Republicans who were rabidly anti-communist -- the "Red scare," "who lost China," Helen Gahagan Douglas, an all that?  What happened?
eng_test_5873	A letter was sent by Representatives and Senators to the FEC, saying:  "We encourage the Federal Election Commission to take immediate steps to understand the threats posed to our democratic process by foreign influenced internet and social media advertisement, and to promulgate new guidance on how advertisement platforms can better prevent foreign nationals from illicitly spending in future U.S. elections"  No brainer right? But yet there were no Republican signatories on the letter.  Does the GOP, while they can get all bent about immigrants redefining America, not think this is a problem?

They stuck my usual sandwich on a croissant, and jacked the price of the combo up 30-40%.  Now I just make my own sandwich and buy a carton of milk and a tin of coffee for the office coffee maker.

That being said... The CRA might appear to go after the poor because they hit the low-hanging fruit which usually is the that segment of the population who can least afford an accountant or who try to do everything themselves.  Of course having worked in the CRA when there was a Liberal government in power (who were going to rip up the GST... twice) and a Conservative government in power I can tell you that nothing changes, and no directives re: who to collect from, makes it down to the collectors, their managers or team leaders.

Having no Republicans in office is worse, than having Republicans in office who are more liberal than their mainland counterparts.  This is Hawaii.  Hawaii constituents are different (more liberal) than their mainland counterparts.  The Hawaii GOP NEEDS to adapt.  Having a State senate with no Republicans is an embarrassment and a huge failure on the GOP party leadership.  The GOP's plan should be: 1. Get Republicans in office. 2. Once you have clout due to increased party size, then you can start pushing the party platform.  If you don't get to step 1.  You will never get to step 2.  Killing off your own party by pushing out the few Republicans you have in office, is the most short sighted thing you can do.

eng_test_5900	You have to stop reading US based propoganda re hydraulic fracturing.   We have a completely different regulatory regime in BC with much stricter controls.  Local industry had begun using reused civic wastewater for fracturing in order to reduce ground water consumption.   http://www.shell.ca/en_ca/about-us/projects-and-sites/groundbirch/dawson-creek-reclaimed-water-project.html    You talk about the cost of remediating old mine sites in southern BC. You said you lived in Ashcroft. Your time would be better spent campaigning against your local polluting industry.  I have driven by the tailings pond for Highland Valley Copper more than once and I am aware that is only one of many mines in the area. It is about 10 kilometers of the worst pollution I have ever witnessed, yet I have never seen you or others say one bad word about your own local problems.   Why?
eng_test_5901	But I strongly suspect it, since it neatly places the blame on the victims, and absolves those who share your values of any responsibility.    Either way, I notice that you, and others, have yet to post a link to back up your claims.   Thus leading to my personal opinion that the poster was deliberately trying to mislead others.   Or deliberately lie, if you prefer.
eng_test_5902	No my two acres is not big enough..actuall not in anyone's backyard.. In their own backyard. Some 10 acres,maybe in the chugach Forest behind Muldoon. And there's no need for a union company to be hired to put in walks, cute fire pits, or leveled to extremes as the Muldoon exit was and still it looks and works the same as it did w/o all the bells and whistles..  Just give them a place like we have that we know we can go to at nite w/o being thrown out or criticized.  There's quite a few who don't choose or want to stay homeless. Put these in charge , like a mayor, so things don't get over abused. And this wouldn't cost near as much as bldg. renovations. Because those who do want to stay in the street will ruin these faster than we can build them
eng_test_5903	A nice try but one I believe "obfuscation" was coined to describe.  I refer to measurable data validated by reproducible tests: You reply with pronouncements.  Ones to which you desperately cling.  But emotion-driven pronouncements none the less.  And as History records, the Dark Ages, when Beliefs trumped Reason, were filled with good people torturing, hanging and burning others at the stake, because the good people "Just Knew", as you seem to,  they were Right and the others were Wrong. And didn't need to prove it..  And Yes. "Demand" for e-cars created by taxes taken from others will result in dealers increasing "Supply".  It's the "Law of Supply and Demand", a.k.a. Market Forces. Albeit, trashed by politicians squandering money they didn't earn.  Aside: "Unreferenced plural pronouns", like "We", are often dishonestly cheap semantics.  E.g. Your "We" doesn't refer to "you and me".  And it's hubris to claim you speak for everyone else. So wouldn't it have been more honest to say "I"?

eng_test_5919	Yea, any proof?
eng_test_5920	I agree. China could prevent the North Korean leader from precipitating the deaths of countless innocents. To think the United States is going to continue tolerating his idiotic provocations and his development of ICBM capability is foolhardy. Trump or any other President's first responsibility is to ensure the safety of American citizens. The NK threat to the US  is fast approaching critical and a pre-emptive attack on NK could occur if Kim carries out his latest plan to fire missiles close to the US base at Guam (the US military may well construe it as an actual attack and react accordingly with the blessing of their Commander-in-Chief). Kim will be solely responsible for the ensuing carnage but China will have allowed him to wreak havoc on the people of NK.

By making the area as miserable as possible they can push out the pesky neighbors, fill the area with renters that have no stake in what happens and can move away if its unpleasant to live there.

eng_test_5936	An employer cannot illegally inhibit a fundamental constitutional right. It can refuse to allow its equipment to be used for that purpose, etc. but it cannot tell an employee they don't have the right to make a personal statement, especially when everyone around them is doing the same, as induring the pledge of allegiance and/or the national anthem. I don't have to stand, salute or do anything at all In those two circumstances.

An obscure measure tying liquor tax to the rate of inflation is not the right ground for a pitched battle against the overwhelming forces of a popular government.

Yes it hurt Alberta and Yes it hurt the Maritimes, but Quebec is where i will get my 78 seats and try to drive another majority govt.

It took Steve Wozniak and other LSD-deluded hippies in San Francisco to build the PC - while  the existing companies like IBM and DEC thought the PDP-11 was what computer-tech should be.  The very big companies are rarely involved in phase 3 - and in fact tend to actively oppose and undermine it with some pretty egregious anti-competitive behaviour. When they realize they can't stop it happening -they either die off or, in very rare cases, join the revolution (think IBM's PC which killed the original Apple by doing the exact same thing cheaper with commodity parts).  In extremely rare (one in a million) cases -a phase 2 company is led by somebody who knows phase 3 must come, and tries to position the company to be part of it when it happens. Even fewer succeed in it. Elon Musk is trying to do that with spaceX right now. This is more visionary than most, but may not work.

At Mass yesterday, the homilist made a passing (and critical) reference to the letter.  In conversation with some of the folks after Mass, I discerned that I may have been the only person there who knew anything about it; and clearly no-one cared about it.  I don't think we will be talking about this much longer; nor should we. There are too many important issues facing the church and the world; we ought not spend a lot of time or energy responding to putative 'corrections' that are evidently not offered in good faith.

As a former police officer I have seen and read of far to many sad cases of what happens when someone puts their own gun into play without the proper skills to know what to do with it after it has been brought into play (i.e. the perp gets that gun and uses against you or some other innocent person).  If you are not prepared for the eventuality of taking another's life, for God's sake leave that gun at home in a lockbox!

She didn't just clean, she literally sanitized every square inch of that 2 story log house. Every stick of furniture had to be moved and "Why not re-arrange while we're at it?"  Curtains had to be taken down and washed and all linens hung on the clothesline "to get rid of the woodsmoke smell." She even had the barrel stove put outside for the summer. We could never find anything after she finished.  All our gloves and mitts were gone from the pile behind the stove. The place reeked of Clorox and Pine-sol and Fels-Naptha soap.

eng_test_5991	[I guess I wasn't clear.] No, you were clear and I agree with you.  But I think your message needed a bit more fleshing out as some seem to take these kinds of comments as a "cyclists vs. motorists" tribal mentality.  For example, HT's, "what say the now holier than thou bike crowd?" and FB's, "I'm sure someone will jump up to defend the biker."  Isn't a "share the road" mentality preferable to an "us versus them" one?

Kerran saat tappelussa iskeä tauluun ja sen pitää riittää, kun se tippuu, matsi päättyy siihen kun se kaveri ottaa lukua.  Se on nyrkkinujakoissa ihan kahden miehen välinen kunniajuttu, että tippunut/sammunut jätetään rauhaan ja munille ei potkita.

On tullut itsekkin koettua kun aikuinen akka yhtäkkiä kääntyy suojatielle polkupyörällä eikä katsonut ollenkaan et tuleeko autoja. Kyllä siinä pisti miettimään että tällaisia(ko) meissä aikuisissakin oikeesti on. Hitto miten tyhmää. Olin oikeesti niin lähellä suojatietä enkä voinut millän käsittää että sieltä vaan vauhdilla käännytään eteen (kai mulla on sitte niin hiljainen auto?) Jälkeenpäin saa todeta että onneksi olin valppaana ja osasin varautua. Mitä jos olisin vaikkapa näppäillyt radiota sillä hetkellä?  Itse koitan niin ennakoivasti ajella ettei edes tarvis pysähtyä vaan hiljennän niin kaukaa että toinen ehtii tien yli mennä. Näin mulle on opetettu autokoulussa.  Sanon vielä sen että käyttäkää järkeä niissä suojatien ylityksissä vaikka kuinka olisi oikeus itsellä mennä ensin. Miettikää onko järkeä hyökätä suojatielle kun rekka on tulossa (60tonnia) Onko sulla oikeesti niin kiire että tuollainen massa pitää pysäyttää just sun takia.

Tämä on jatkunut liian kauan, Kokoomus ja muut valtapuolueet käyttää sitä aseenaan että keskustellaan ja keskustellaan, eli se ei johda mihinkään, sen ne tietää itsekin, mutta kun on edustaja joka huutelee, että sähän olet saatanan vitun idiootti, tyhmä apina jne.  Kyllähän sieltä pihalle kannetaan, mutta se myös herätää silloin huomiota ja myös huomiota maailmalla jolloin Kataisellekin aletaan nauramaan maailmalla.

fin_test_91	Minkälaisen luuserin kakkoseksi olet päätynyt? Mies viettää vaimon pakottamana joulua perheensä kanssa ja ajattelee sinua? Etkö parempaa miestä löydä? Jos mies ei halua viettää joulua perheensä kanssa, eikö hänen ihan itse aikuisena ihmisenä pitäisi hoitaa asiat siten, että saisi viettää nautinnollisen ja haluamansa joulun. Ja toivottavasti et vastaa, ettet häntä omaksesi edes halua. En nimittäin sitä edes tarkoita. Miehen - ja naisten - pitäisi tehdä omat ratkaisunsa eikä roikkua löysässä hirressä, kun eivät parempaankaan pysty.  Jos olet miesystävällesi Ihminen, pyydä häntä tekemään elämässään ratkaisut siltä pohjalta, että kerranhan täällä vain eletään. Jos mies kökkii eukkonsa vahdittavana vaikkapa lapsilla kiristäminen takia, jätä mokoma luuseri. Sellaisesta miehestä ei voi olla pitemmän päälle kuin harmia.

fin_test_144	Uskonto on sairaus  ...ja sellaisena sitä tulisi hoitaa. Toiset ovat pahempia kuin toiset, mutta yhtä kaikki, imevät ihmisten verta niin kauan kuin ihmisessä vähänkään on annettavaa ja sitten jättävät kuolemaan. Näillä on ihan nimikin - loinen.  Olen koittanut ymmärtää uskovaisia, ovathan ne päällepäin kilttejä ja "hengellisiä". Miten sellaisiin voisi suhtautua negatiivisesti? Mutta, nyt loppui kärsivällisyys. Tämä järjettömyys on mennyt riittävän pitkälle.  Uskonnot eivät ole mitään muuta kuin massojen hallintaan tarkoitettu väline jonka ainoa päämäärä on opettaa ihmisille etteivät he ole itse vastuussa elämästään, että orjana heidän elämänsä on jonkun arvoista. Tottele raamattua, tottele pappia, tottele poliitikkoja, tottele rahaa, kas olet muka onnellisempi. On valmis kirja mitä seurata, kuinka sopivaa. Ei tarvitse itse miettiä mitään, kun lukaisee opuksen, ja kas; elämä onkin selvä. Jeesus / Allah / joku hihhuli / Joulupukki sen kaiken tietää, eikä minun tarvitse mitään muuta tehdä, kuin ottaa hyvä asento ja totella.  Oikeasti nämä ihmiset ovat päästä sekaisin, ihan tosissaan. Mormoonit sentään avoimesti keksivät niin uskomattoman typerän tekstin että varmistivat ettei siihen kukaan täysipäinen usko, näin saatiin porukkaan vain kaikista typerimmät idiootit ja kas, homma toimii kuin junan vessa. Mutta, nämä kristityt hihhulit, voi elämä, että osaa olla vajaa päistä porukkaa. 2000 vuotta ovat kupanneet ihmiskuntaa parhaimpansa mukaan, eikä Islamilaiset ole sen parempia.  Ajattelin aiemmin että, kyllähän näitä hihhuleja sietää. Mikäs siinä kun ovat hihhuleita niin ovat, jokainen saa olla millainen haluaa. Näin ajattelin. Ja ajattelin kyllä vieläkin, mutta mitä minä en voi sietää enää sekuntiakaan on organisoitu, pappisvetoinen järjestäytynyt uskonto. Se on täsmälleen sama asia kuin natsismi. Ainoa, mikä erottaa natsin ja uskovaisen on tapa millä toimivat, mutta maali on täsmälleen sama. Kaikkien on uskottava siihen mitä pomo sanoo, oli se oikein tai oli se väärin, mutta pomo juttelee jumalan kanssa, niin tottahan toki hänen on oltava oikeassa. Kuinka tyhmä ihmisen pitää olla jotta uskoo tuohon sontaan? Kaikista parhaiten tämä näkyy siinä kuinka nämä "uskonnot" suhtautuvat itsenäisesti ajatteleviin ihmisiin: saatanasta, perkeleestä ja pirusta ne ajatukset tulevat. Ajatteleminen on syntiä. That's it. Näitähän sitten saa kivitellä ja syrjiä kuin parhaaksi kukin hihhuli katsoo.  Se miksi kirjoitan tätäkin vuodatusta nyt on että olen kyllästynyt tähän järjettömyyteen ja poliittisesti korrektiin "hienovaraisuuteen" niiden ääliöiden osalta joilla edes sen verran leikkaa ettei usko hihhuleiden pyhiin teksteihin. Halutaanko me tästä maasta sellainen että jokaisen eri hihhulin uskoa pitäisi kunnioittaa? Minkä ihmeen takia meidän pitäisi niitä kunnioittaa? MIKSI? Jos joku uskoo että maapallo on litteä, niin ei kai sen puheita oteta vakavasti. Mutta, annas olla, kun samanlainen sekopää kertoo kuinka jumala juttelee hänelle, niin hän on tietysti oikeassa vähintään siinä asiassa, että jutteleeko se omnipotentti valopää hänelle. Tämä poliittinen korrektius johtaa siihen että kun maailma yhdistyy koko ajan enemmän ja rajat katoavat niin mitähän te veikkaatte mitenkä käy uskontojen kanssa ellei kohta asiaan aleta puuttua? Ja mitenhän tulee käymään meidän rauhallisille ja maallisille uskonnoille? Tämä on sellainen asia mitä pitäisi luterilaisen kirkonkin ruveta miettimään ihan tosissaan, mikäli sille kelpaa olemassa olo. Jos ihmiset haluavat että jokainen sekopää saa uskoa mihin haluaa, niin uskonnoille on asetettava tiukat rajat. Ei sen takia ettenkö anna muiden tehdä niin kuin tykkää vaan, sen takia, että jossain vaiheessa joku uskonto tulee ottamaan vallan ja kas, yhtäkkiä kaikkien pitää siihen uskoa. Kylmä totuus on vain sellainen, että jokainen uskonto/lahko haluaa lisää ihmisiä eikä tule lopettamaan ennen kuin on käännyttänyt koko pallon. Vaikka jonkun uskonnon maailman valtaus yritys jäisikin puolitiehen, ei se poista sitä etteikö nämä jaksaisi kiljua itselleen erivapauksia. Pitää saada kivittää raiskattuja naisia, pitää saada silpoa lapsia, pitää saada sekoittaa lasten päätä helvetillä ja ties millä perkeleillä. Pitää saada moniavioisuus, pitää saada vaikka kuu taivaalta jos joku kaheli niin päättää. Vingutaan jatkuvasti tunnustusta ja arvostusta kun ansaitsevat korkeintaan halveksuntaa.  Verotusoikeus pois ja lahjoituksille verot. Uskontojen "suosiminen" kouluista pois, ja opettava osana historiaa ja/tai yhteiskunta tieteitä. Alaikäisten ihmisten kastamisen ja kirkkoon liittäminen on kiellettävä. Aikuisena saavat tehdä mitä tykkäävät, mutta ennen sitä yhteiskunnan on suojeltava heitä. Kaikki järjetön silpominen (ympärileikkaukset jne.) ilman lääkärin suositusta terveydellisin syin on kiellettävä. Kirkon toimintaa on verotettava rankimman mukaan. Aivan samalla tavalla kuin alkoholia ja tupakkaa.  Toki uskonnoissa on hyvätkin puolensa, lähinnä niistä irtoava musta huumori. Esimerkiksi nämä hihhulit kysyvät, että mistä moraali tai eettiset säännöt tulevat jos ei mihinkään usko? Samalla sanovat että jos eivät uskoisi jumalaan, niin juoksisivat ympäriinsä kännissä tappaen ja raiskaten ihmisiä. Tällaisella älykkyydellä varustettua ihmistä, tulee ihan oikeasti varoa, uskoi tai ei. Toinen "hauska" asia on sanoa ateismia uskonnoksi. Missä kohtaa ateismi on uskonto? En kyllä edes ymmärrä minkä takia tämä on uskonto & uskomukset kategorian alle, kun ateismi nimenomaan tarkoittaa sitä ettei usko mihinkään hihhuliin. Se on negaatio sanasta usko, vastakohta. Se ei ole sama asia, mitenkään. Jos valinta olisi joulupukin ja jeesuksen välillä niin sitten voisi sanoa että ero on uskossa, mutta ateisti ei usko.  Yksi vätys porukka on agnostikot. Pelataan molemmilla pöydillä kun ei uskalleta ottaa kantaa ja luottaa omaan päähänsä. Vähän uskotaan, ettei suututeta yläkerran herraa ja vähän ei uskota ettei kaverit katso kieroon. Sanonko suoraan? Sanon. Olette hanurista koko sakki. Mielinkielin kaikkiin suuntiin kun ei uskalleta ottaa kantaa.  Uskontoja ei saa kunnioittaa. Se on ensimmäinen ja viimeinen virhe. Jos niitä kunnioittaa ne tulevat kyllä ja vaativat aina ja aina enempi ja enempi. Hyväksikäyttävät typeriä ihmisiä ja heidän turvallisuuden tunteen tarvetta. Mihin maailma on menossa jos ei suitsita uskontoja? Eipä kamalasti tarvitse katsella maailman menoa niin saa hyvän kuvan maanpäällisestä helvetistä. Tätäkö me halutaan tänne myös? Lopettakaa se hienovaraisuus. Me ei kaivata tähän maahan uskontojen terrorismia. Hyvänä esimerkkinä nämä allah pilapiirrokset. Välittömästi pääministeriä myöten maa polvillaan. Missä on selkäranka? Missä on sananvapauden puolustaminen? MISSÄ?  Nimenomaan tätä se uskonto on. Ehkei meidän luterilainen hillitty uskonto ole näyttänyt pahinta karvaa, mutta älkää unohtako että ihan samaa kauraa se on, eri lautasella. Uskonnot terrorisoivat kansaa, miksi? Siksi että mitä surkeampi on ihmisten tila, sitä enemmän ne saavat seuraajia. Hyvin yksinkertaista. Kun ihmisellä on tarpeeksi hätä, tunnustaahan se vaikka Peukaloisen jumalakseen jos sillä saa ruokaa / turvaa. Onko se oikein? EI OLE.  0

fin_test_161	Kuinka tälläistä sallitaan maailmassa  Tulipas taas oikein kunnon dokumentti noista palestiinalaisista itsemurhapommittajista. Tänään 12,7-06. Miten on mahdollista,että jotkut voivat olla noin perkeleen yksinkertaisia "ihmisiä" kuin muslimit? Ei mene jakeluun ainakaan minulle. Jauhavat tuota iänikuista paskamantraa paratiisista ja neitsyistä. Tuntuu käsittämättömältä ,että noin uskonnon kyllästämiä ja elämästä tietämättömiä "ihmisiä" voi olla olemassa. Herää kysymys: Mikä planeetta tämä oikein on? Tuollaiset puoliapinat ovat todella vaarallisia sivistyneelle ihmiskunnalle. Ne pitäisi eristää kokonaan muusta maailmasta. Ihan siis vankimielisairaalan tyyliin, pehmeään koppiin lopuksi iäksi. Tämähän ei tietenkään ole mahdollista. Mutta ne voisi jättää oman onnensa nojaan, tuet poikki, diplomaattisuhteet poikki, matkustuskielto kumpaankin suuntaan, kauppasaarto yms,,niin ne tappaisivat toisensa ennenpitkää. Islamin usko tulisi myös kieltää terroristisena ja väkivaltaa ihannoivana ja levittävänä idalismina. Kuinka on mahdollista, että joidenkin "uskonto" pohjautuu pahaan, tappamiseen, kurkkujen leikkaamiseen, itsensä ja muiden räjäyttelyyn. Ja sitten sellainen vielä hyväksytään monikulttuurisuuden nimissä. Tuossakin ohjelmassa pienet lapset hokivat fraaseja kurkun leikkaamisesta vääräuskoisilta ja toinen , vielä vauva, heilutteli asetta ja laittoi pyssynpiipun suuhunsa. Siis natsijärjestöt ovat täydellisiä pyhäkouluja noiden rinnalla mutta ovat silti kiellettyjä ja tuomittavia. Mutta tuollaista eläimellistä käytöstä sallitaan uskonnon ja erillaisen kulttuurin varjolla.

No ei, koska meillähän on Euroopan vakuuttavin ministeri, eli puolustusministeri Haglund. Aivan pelle, ei edes Suomen armeijaa käytynä! Jopa puol. minstr. Elisabeth Rehn oli parempi kuin nykyinen.

Kertokaa mitä vain ideoita joita tulee mieleen, mutta apuohjat, raipat ja kannukset yms. hylätään heti kättelyssä. Heppa liikkuu paremmin ja tyytyväisemin riimulla ratsastaessa, kuin olympiakuolaimilla. Kuolaimettomat suiset hankinnassa. Ruuna on ex ravuri mutta toiminut ratsuna jo viitisen vuotta.

Toistaiseksi laitoksemme historian ainut "tissikortti" - ainakin oman muutamavuotisen oleskeluni aikana, vaikka monia maisemakortteja tulee - ja hyvin soveltui suomalaisen imagoon :-)  En olisi tuota tissikorttia laittanut, ellei tuo sihteeri olisi aloittanut ;-) (ja hän tietää sen).  Miten suhtautuisit, jos naiskollega esittäisi sinulle kommentin mieskollegastasi: "onpas tuolla kiinteä perse"? Ilmeisesti järkyttyisit, tai "pakko kai sinun olisi jotain vastata"?

Suomessa heidän pauloihinsa joutuneilta ukkomiehiltä ym. asiaan vihkiytyneiltä asian harrastajilta! Ukkomiehille jopa siis heteroille mutta useimmiten bi-miehille on yhdentekevää jos on naisen vaatteet ja releet ja liukas halukas reikä vaikka olisi homokin lähtökohtaisesti tms. "Miehet on tyhmät" totesi murteellaan yksikin trans-sukupuolen korjaukseen ryhtynyt henkilö taannoin!  Ja tämän ominaisuuden tiedetään vetoavan ja siksi miesten sanotaan yksinkertaista mutta seksiin taipuvaa luonnetta hyväksikäytetään näissä ympyröissä varsin paljon! Jos oma vaimo kieltäytyy seksistä sitä saa homoilta ja siinä tansuilevilta miehiltä helposti ja jopa maksutta!

fin_test_249	No ihan sillä perusteella, että tuo FW31J on 200-300€ halvempi. Kuten jo sanoin, jos ei tarvitse polttavaa blu-rayta niin silloin tuo FW31J järkevin. Prosessorien välinen tehoerohan noissa on käytännössä pieni eikä nähdäkseni tuossa kovalevyn koossakaan juuri eroa (400gt vs 500gt). Ja bonuksena FW31J:ssä on näköjään nopeampi kovalevy (5400rpm vs. 4200rpm).  En siis näe mitään syytä miksi maksaisin tuosta FW31M mallista 300€ extraa ellen sitten tarvitsisi tuota polttavaa Blu-rayta, mutta valinanhan teet toki sinä enkä minä... ;)

Kyllä hän pitää huolen lampaistaan että eivät joudu vääräuskoisten nöyryytettäväksi.  Rysille mansikanpoiminta käy vallan mainiosti.

Taitaa vain kommunismi todistanut itsensä täydellisesti kuolleeksi hevoseksi jota ei enää kenekään pitäisi yrittää elvyttää henkiin.
fin_test_258	Fundamentalismista  Fundamentalismi on harhakuvitelmaa, jonka mukaan Jumala odottaa ja edellyttää ihmiseltä Kristus-uskon lisäksi uskoa tuhansia vuosia vanhan 1200-sivuisen kirjoitusten kokoelman absoluuttiseen erehtymättömyyteen ja ristiriidattomuuteen. Fundamentalismi on toisin sanoen näkemys ja vakaumus, että usko Kristukseen ei yksin riitä. Fundamentalismi on malliesimerkki opista, josta Paavali kirjoittaa: "Jos joku julistaa teille evankeliumia, joka on vastoin sitä, minkä olette saaneet, hän olkoon kirottu." Edellä sanottuun fundamentalisti toteaa: "Ethän sinä tietäisi Kristuksesta ja Paavalin evankeliumista mitään, jollei sinulla olisi Raamattua." Ja jättää lisäämättä: "Siksi sinun on uskottava KAIKKEEN MUUHUNKIN, mitä Raamattuun on kirjoitettu." Tämä on vasta-argumenttina niin kiero/typerä, että sille on hankala löytää vertailukohtaa. Mutta yritetään. Fundamentalisti on kuin mies, joka inttää: "Luit Kimi Räikkösen maailmanmestaruudesta Helsingin Sanomista. Sinulla ei ole mitään oikeutta uskoa Kimi Räikkösen maailmanmestaruuteen, jollet usko Helsingin Sanomien ja sen edeltäjän Päivälehden absoluuttiseen erehtymättömyyteen ja ristiriidattomuuteen vuodesta 1889 lähtien." Ikään kuin Kimi Räikkösen Ferrarilla vuonna 2007 Brasiliassa voittama maailmanmestaruus olisi jotenkin riippuvainen siitä, kuinka tarkasti ja oikeaan osuvasti kymmenet ja sadat toimittajat ovat asetelleet sanojaan helsinkiläisen sanomalehden toimituksessa esimerkiksi vuosina 1897, 1913, 1929 ja 1963. Vuoden 2007 uutinen Kimi Räikkösen maailmanmestaruudesta on toisin sanoen pelkkää huuhaata, jos joku Hesarin toimittaja teki vuonna 1927 virheen raportoidessaan eduskuntavaaleista. Toinen, vielä idioottimaisempi argumentti kuuluu: "Raamattu julistaa itse olevansa Jumalan Sanaa." Kyseinen virke on monipuolisimmin mieletön lausuma, jonka ihminen on suustaan/näppikseltään päästänyt. Se on sekä valhe että kehäpäätelmä. Ja tällaisten idioottimaisuuksien fundamentalistit kuvittelevat olevan olennainen osa evankeliumia. Ja sitten toki ihmetellään, kun kaiken maailman räsäsiä ja puolimatkoja pidetään hieman tärähtäneinä.

fin_test_264	kaverisi siis häpeää tunnustaa homouttaan. hän varmaankin pelkää menettävänsä kaverinsa, ja onhan siinä osin toki syynsäkin, monet heterot suhtautuvat ennakkoluuloisesti homoseksuaaleihin, sillä kuvittelevat heidän esimerkiksi katselevan itseään, ja tuntevat olonsa ahdistuneeksi heidän seurassa.  mutta oudointa on se, että eivät miehet ja naiset keskenään välttämättä tunne ahdistuneisuutta, vaan voivat aivan helposti olla kavereita.  kaverisi olisi ehkä kaikkein parasta myöntää itselleen ja muille seksuaalinen suuntautumisensa, ehkä hän voisi löytää itsellensä sopivan jätkäkaverin ja elää onnellisena?  mielestäni on väärin hävetä sitä mitä on. en minäkään kuolaa kaikkien kavereideni perään vaikka olenkin bi-seksuaali, ja kaverini tietävät sen. jos se heitä haittaisi, niin se ei olisi kyllä minun ongelmani.  mutta kaverisi tekee itse sotkunsa. tietysti asia no ahdistava mutta sen kertominen helpottaisi huomattavasti.  sinun on tosin pidettävä suusi kiinni jos olet lupautunut niin tekemään :/

Vauvahan se on mikä sieltä putkahtaa.  Raskausaikana on ihan normaalia ajatella tulevaa lastaan vauvana. Koska vauva-ikä vaatii ihan himputista vanhemmilta, kun kaikki on uuttakin ja niin. Kyllä sitä lasta alkaa miettimään lapsen harkitsemis vaiheessa ja raskauden aikana myös, enemmänkin jos on vaikka vahinkoraskaus kyseessä. Että millaista elämä on sitten kun lapsi on kouluikäinen jne.  Älkääkä kaikkea ottako kirjaimellisesti.  Ja monista nyt jo aikuisista entisistä teiniäideistä olen huomannut että heillä on elämä mennyt ihan hienosti. Ainut mikä heitä on koskaan harmittanut on se että heihin on suhtauduttu huonosti vaikka itsellään kaikki on ollut hyvin ja ennenkaikkea vauvalla.

fin_test_272	Ruusun päivä  Tänään 4.5 on Ruusun päivä. Siispä ojennamme ruusun Ruusuille ja ruusuisillemme. Tänään vietetään myös kirjan ja ruusun päivää. Mistä moinen perinne on saanut alkunsa? Vilkaisu Wikipediaan,vapaaseen tietosanakirjaan, niin asia selviää.  Ruusutietoa Kirjan ja ruusun päivän perinne Kirjan ja ruusun päivän perinne, jossa mies lahjoittaa naiselle punaisen ruusun ja nainen lahjoittaa kirjan miehelle, juontaa juurensa keskiaikaiseen taruun Katalonian suojeluspyhimyksestä Pyhästä Yrjöstä. Ritari Pyhä Yrjö surmasi legendan mukaan lohikäärmeen, joka oli aikeissa ahmaista kitaansa kauniin prinsessan. Surmatun lohikäärmeen verestä versoi tulipunaisia ruusuja täynnä oleva ruusupensas, josta sankari poimi kauneimman kukan prinsessalle. Pyhä Yrjö julistettiin keskiajalla Katalonian suojeluspyhimykseksi ja huhtikuun 23:nnesta tuli pyhimyksen juhlapäivä. Pyhän Yrjön päivää on juhlittu laajasti Kataloniassa ja muualla Euroopassa keskiajalta lähtien. Mutta mikä liittää ruusut ja kirjat yhteen? Legenda lohikäärmeestä ja ruususta on ollut yksi innoittaja, mutta tapa yhdistää kukat ja kirjat voidaan jäljittää myös keskiaikaan. Kataloniassa kukat olivat palkintona Jocs Florals -kirjallisuuskilpai- luissa, jota vietettiin Pyhän Yrjön päivänä. Nykyisin vietettävän Kirjan ja ruusun päivän alkuperä on vuodessa 1926, jolloin huhtikuun 23. valittiin barcelonalaisen kirjakauppiaan idean mukaan kirjojen ja ruusujen päiväksi. Myös päivän kirjallinen historia oli yhtenä innoittajana: 23.4.1616 kaksi maailmankirjallisuuden klassikkokirjailijaa, Miguel Cervantes de Saavedra sekä William Shakespeare, kuoli. Huhtikuun 23. on myös Halldór Kiljan Laxnessin ja Vladimir Nabokovin syntymäpäivä. 1995 Unesco julisti katalonialaisen Kirjan ja ruusun päivän Maailman kirjan ja tekijänoikeuden päiväksi. "Kirjat ansaitsevat erityisen päivänsä, jolloin niitä juhlitaan vapauden, yhteenkuuluvuuden ja rauhan symboleina", sen julistus kuului. Kirjan ja ruusun päivää ja Maailman kirjan päivää ei kaikkialla juhlita juuri huhtikuussa, vaan monet maat ovat sovittaneet päivän itselleen sopivaan ajankohtaan. Esimerkiksi Iso-Britanniassa ja Irlannissa tapahtumaa vietettiin tänä vuonna 2. maaliskuuta. Vaikka päivää vietetään eri maissa eri aikoina, kannatetaan kaikkialla päivän alkuperäistä ideaa ja Unescon periaatteita.

Loukkaako tämä kenenkään yksityisyyttä tai mitään lakia, jos luetellaan ihmisten tietoja muiden kuullen? Kaipaan todellista tietoa en mielipiteitä.

fin_test_302	Yritän saada tietoja väittämistäsi rikoksista, jotta voisin saattaa ne tutkinnan alle.  "Hölmöyttäsi yrität näköjään ylittää itsesi typeryytesi paljastamisessa vihjailemamalla, että upseerin velvollisuus olisi muka ollut tappaa ja tapattaa omia sotilaita? Puolustus on vähintään yhtä naurettava kuin puolustelijakin. Rikosten tekeminen ei ole ollut eikä ole kenenkään velvollisuus. Asiansa osaavat upseerit osasivat täyttää maanpuolustusvelvollisuutensa syyllistymättä rikoksiin. Mustamaalaukseen syyllistyt itse rinnastaessasi halpamaiset rikolliset velvollisuutensa täyttäneisiin sotilaisiin."  Esimiehn aseenkäytöstä tietyissä tilanteissa määrätään sotaväen rikoslain 38 §:n 1. momentissa ja sotaväen järjestyssäännön 5 §:ssä. Et näy tietävän näitäkään perusasioita. Näiden säädösten ulkopuolella tapahtunut aseenkäyttö omia miehiä kohtaan täyttää yleensä rikoksen tuntomerkit. Jos kerran tiedät tällaisia taopauksia, niin velvollisuutesi on ne ilmoittaa. Missähän kohdassa olen rinnastanut "halpamaiset rikolliset velvollisuutensa täyttäneisin upseereihin".  Sinähän tässä esitätä koko ajan väitteitä upseerien rikoskista. Esittäisit lopulta yhdenkin.

Jos näitä uunoja nyt perähikiöiltä enemmänkin eduskuntaan tulee niin ajatelkaa kun heille täytyy opettaa alusta asti esim. ruokailutapoja, kravatin solmiminen, kokouskäytäntöjä, kaupungissa liikkumista jne.

fin_test_337	Nythän tämä menee jo aiheeta sivuun, mutta jos mielenkiintosi kohdistui tuohon, niin selitän:  1. Kone tuli vaihdossa kun myin edellistä venettäni pois, sain tarvittavan rahan ja lisäksi mukaan koneen, periaatteessa kone oli ilmainen minulle.  2. Moottori oli nykyiseen apujollaani/kalaveneeseen oikein sopiva teholtaan.  3. Olen tällähetkellä työtön, tuskin saisin velatta ostettua ehjää konetta, tai korjautettua tuota korjaamossa. Työttömyys tarkoittaa myös räpläämiseen liikenevää aikaa.  4. En usko kyseessä olevan oppimisenhalu, vaan pikemminkin tarve näyttää itselle (ja tietenkin kavereille), että miksei onnistuisi itsekorjaten...  Muutenkin pidän kommenttiasi outona, koska tekniikkaa on paljon erilaista. Ei kysymykseni viittaa että en tekniikasta ymmärtäisi, uskon että joskus "oikea" perämoottorihuoltaja miettii, kuka häntä voisi valaista jossain oudossa teknisessä ongelmassa, eli kuka on ollut saman ongelman edessä. Siihen nämä foorumit vaan perustuu, sori.

Kummankin osalta voin kertoa,että menimme "vieraisiin", koska kumpikaan ei suhteelta saanut sitä, mitä kaikki tarvitsevat.  Seksiä oli, ilman läheisyyttä..Pusuja ja suudelmia oli, ilman tunnetta.. Kaikkea OLI, kunnes emäntä lähti kävelemään.  Näin tulevaisuutta ajatellen.. Voisitteko kertoa mielipiteenne siitä, että mikä voisi mahdollisesti saada juttumme toimimaan?

En ole varma kysymyksestäsi. Minulla on DVD:tä (leffoja) joissa on oikeasti a- ja b-puoli kuten vanhoissa vinyyleissä, mutten ole taas törmännyt muihin tyhjiin CD/DVD levyhin kuin mitkä ovat "ns" dual layer levyjä.

fin_test_351	keitä anarkistit oikein luulevat olevansa?  Tälläkin palstalla rellestävät punikki-loiset yrittävät kantaa ylpeänä titteliä anarkisti. Mielestäni kyseiset punaloiset eivät ole anarkisteja nähneetkään. Jos on anarkisti, asettautuu koko nykyisen järjestelmän ulkopuolelle eikä toimi sen keskuudessa millään muotoa. Nykyiset "anarkistit" haisevat kotonaan paskalta ja nostavat työmarkkinatukea ja sossurahoja yrittäen samalla esittää kovaakin kapinoitsijaa. Ei ne muutamat punkkikeikat teistä anarkisteja tee, eikä huumeiden veto tai kaljan jatkuva kiskominen. Todellisuudessa olette yhteiskunnasta riippuvaisia orjia jotka kuuluvat sen alimpaan kastiin.

Moraaliin vetoaminen on ongelmallista siksi, että kaikilla on oma moraalinsa. Lähtökohta oikeusvaltiossa on kuitenkin se, että vain laki viime kädessä ratkaisee, mikä on sallittua ja mikä ei. Kenenkään yksittäisen ihmisen moraali ei sitä tee, vaikka henkilö tuntisi itsensä kuinka yleväksi moraaliltaan.  Minun moraalini mukaan on parisuhteessa elävien keskinäinen asia, harrastavatko he seksiä parisuhteen ulkopuolella vai eivät. Sitä ei pidä lailla säädellä.

Samoin toivon hänen myös suhtautuvan mun itsemääräämisoikeuteeni onasta alapäästäni.

Raha ei siis sinansa ole mulle tarkeaa, mutta palkalla pitaisi kuitenkin pystya elamaan paakaupunkiseudulla, ja sen takia kyselen..  Osaatteko siis kertoa suunnilleen parin sadan euron tarkkuudella, kuinka paljon maara-aikainen opettaja saa palkkaa ala-asteella, jos viikkotunteja on n. 24, tai sitten ylaasteella, jossa viikkotunteja olisi n. 20?

fin_test_372	Inhoan omaa vartaloani  Inhoan todella paljon vartaloani. Minua oksettaa olla näin kamalan hoikka 57kg ja 168cm. Rintani ovat onnettomat c 75 kokoa. Olen koittanut saada lisää painoa, mutta aina ne kertyvät vain makkaroiksi vatsaani. Tahtoisin olla paljon muodokkaampi ja naisellisempi vartaloltani. Haaveilen tiimalasi vartalosta. Kylkeni ja vatsani ovat liian suuret. Ainakin 5cm pitäisi saada pois. Tahtoisin saada lihaksekkaamman vartalon, jalat ja kädet. Ongelmani on, että ajattelen rumaa vartaloani kokoajan ja tahdon saada sen paremmaksi :( Aina kun aamulla herään ekana tulee mieleen miten ruma vartalo minulla on. Kaupungilla tulee vastaan seksikkäitä naisia jatkuvasti. Itse olen tämmöinen ruma luikku,en tiedä mitä tehdä asialle. En osaa hyväksyä itseäni, tahdon olla paljon nätimpi :(

fin_test_446	>  Tässä tunnustat, että olen oikeassa: hiilihydraatti ei ole sama asia kuin sokeri. Miksi ihmeessä sitten vielä kiellät tämän faktan ?  >  Niin sitä helposti "kyllästyy" kun tulee eteen tilanne, jossa on vaan pakko tunnustaa olevansa väärässä. Tee se nyt, niin päästään eteenpäin.  >  Vitut, kirjoitit hiilihydraatit = sokeri. Älä yritä perääntyä väitteistäsi, ääliö.  Nyt sitten lue oikein helvetillisen tarkasti tämän keskustelun aloitus. Siinä lukee mm. nämä faktat: japanilaiset eivät kärsineet lihavuudesta eikä sen liitännäissairauksista kun heidän ruokavalionsa koostui erittäin suurelta osin hiilihydraatista (jopa 67 E-%). Vasta myöhemmin kun heidän hiilihydraattikuormansa on vähentynyt ja rasvakuorma lisääntynyt, niin heidän diabetesluvut ovat alkaneet nousta. Miksei 67 E-% hiilihydraattia syövät ihmiset ole lihavia vaikka hiilihydraatti mielestäsi lihottaa ? Aivan, väittämäsi on täyttä hihhulipaskaa. Hiilihydraatit eivät lihota. Ainoastaan ylimääräiset syödyt kalorit lihottaa.  >  Jos rasvaa ei syö yli kulutuksensa. Jos taas syö yli kulutuksensa, niin on aivan sama, mitä se ylitse menevä osuus on, rasvaa, proteiinia, hiilihydraattia tai alkoholia, niin ihminen lihoaa.  Ei se rasva, katsos vajakki, mihinkään toiseen ulottuvuuteen katoa, jos syöt sitä liikaa. Se jää vyötärölle.  >  Ilmeisesti siis myös Wikipedian kirjoittajatkin ovat torvia: "In general, the monosaccharides and disaccharides, which are smaller (lower molecular weight) carbohydrates, are commonly referred to as sugars". Mene ihmeessä korjaamaan, jos "tiedät", että hiilihydraatti on sama asia kuin sokeri. Todellakin: mono- ja disakkaridit nimetään sokereiksi, mutta polysakkaridit saavat rakenteensa funktiona nimet selluloosa, tärkkelys jne.  Sokeri [Wikipedia: "Sokerit ovat hiilihydraatteja, joiden molekyylit koostuvat yhdestä (monosakkaridit) tai kahdesta (disakkaridit) sokeriyksiköstä".] todellakin on juuri sitä (usein) makealta maistuvaa tavaraa. Siitä käytetään nimitystä sokeri. Muista hiilihydraateista käytetään nimitystä tärkkelys, selluloosa jne. Ne ovat eri asioita - juuri kuten sanoitkin: niillä on eri GI. Jep, siksi ne eivät ole sama asia kuin lyhytketjuiset (tai monomeeriset) sokerit.  >  Se muodostuu sokerista, mutta ei ole lyhytketjuista (tai monomeerista). Talon runko muodostuu puusta, mutta talon runko ei ole sama asia kuin puu (todennäköisesti olet sen verran syvällä tuossa idiotismissasi, ettet pysty tajuamaan näinkin selkeää eroa asioiden välillä, hiilihydraatti muodostuu sokerista, mutta esim. selluloosa ei ole sama asia kuin sokeri - sillä on rakenteellinen funktio, joka erottaa sen "rakennuskappaleistaan": rakennuksen runko ei ole puu vaikka rakennuksen runko muodostuu puusta).

fin_test_452	Olen täysin samaa mieltä!! Mielestäni on rumaa oman lapsen vakavat sairas jutut levittä iltapäivä lehdille.. Jos mun äiti olisi tehnyt noin olisin raivoissani! Kaikki missä Sanna pallonaama ontai esiintyy en voi edes kuulla tai katsoa.. Yököttävä ämmä.
fin_test_453	Heitit muuten ihan hemmetin vaikeasti vastattavan kysymyksen...  Et ole syntynyt väärälle planeetalle, väärään aikaan tai väärään uskontoon.  Ei, kyllä suomea puhuvassa maailmassa on miehet ja naiset yhdenvertaisia mitä tulee yksilöyteen, parisuhteeseen ja seksiin.  Oikeassa rakastelussa pitää olla oikea henkinen yhteys, paitsi jos kyse on vain raakasta seksistä. On tavallaan valitettavaa, että pornoteollisuuden moottorointi esineellistää naista ihan sata- nolla ja tätä kautta niin monen heikomman mieltä muokataan suuntaan, missä esineellistetty nainen on helpompi hoitaa maaliin ilman että itse pitää olla... oikeastaan mitään. Tuon teollisuuden teemahan on "Nainen on siinä sinua varten, mies".  Ihan pimeee setti oikeasti...  Itse olen valmis tekemään mitä vain, jotta vaimollani on hyvä ja tyydytetty olo.

fin_test_465	No kirjoitustyylistäsi voi jo päätellä millaisia jälkeläisiä sinä maailmalle työnnät.  Nynnyys = tunteva ja muista välittävä ihminen. Kyllä sellaisia minun lapsistani toivottavasti tulee. Vaikka eihän nuo arvot ole muodissa enää. Nykyään röyhkeys, itsekkyys ja julmuus on hyväksyttäviä arvoja ja niitä sinä ilmeisesti lapsillesi koitat opettaa. Ja varmasti menee oppi perille kun malliesimerkki löytyy omasta äidistä. Opetatko sinä lapsesi kiusaamaan "nynnyjä"? Ilmeisesti kyllä sillä voiko pahempaa "vikaa" lapsessa olla kuin "nynnyys"?  Vai et jaksa leikkiä lapsesi kanssa? On se rankkaa tuo työttömän arki juu. Siinähän sitä voimat menee kun täytyy sixpackejä kantaa selkä vääränä. No onneksi kaikki työttömät eivät ole kaltaisiasi kaljasieppoja.
fin_test_466	Säästöt ovat maakunnalla ankarat ja niitä yritetään nyt todella kerätä sekä vanhus- että vammaispalveluista. Miten ihmeessä nämä alijäämät yritetään ruohonjuuritasolta raapia? Mahtaa tulla loppupeleissä maksamaan ja moninkertaisesti. Aune ja Ahti, kiitos teidän kannanotoistanne mielipideosastolla. Omaisilla kannattaisi nyt perätä omaistensa hoidon tasoa ja mitä on kirjoitettu palvelusuunnitelmiin. Pystytäänkö enää hoitamaan vanhusta, niinkuin on sovittu palvelusuunnitelmissa. Niitä on aivan turha tehdä, jos käytännössä hoitajan resussit ei riitä sovittua hoitotasoa ylläpitämään. Kuka näistä säästötoimista ottaa vastuun ja mitä ne tuo vielä tullessaan? On kyse ihmisistä, jotka ovat tämän hyvinvoinnin meille luoneet ja meidän kuuluu hoitaa ja huolehtia heidän hyvinvoinnista, eikä karsia niitä. HÄVETTÄÄ!
fin_test_467	Jo nyt näkyy työvoimapula. Jokainen työkuntoinen saa halutessaan töitä.  Eri asia on muuttajista monellekaan riittävää työtaitoa. Sama asia on useimmilla työttömillä Suomessa. Lapiomiehiä ei enää tarvita ja Elannon hevosmiehetkin ovat lakossa.
fin_test_468	En Michaelia koska pedofiilit ja muut rikolliset aina kiistää rikoksen...  Et usko Michaelia koska hän kiistää rikoksen? Pitäisikö syyttömien sitten myöntää syyllisyytensä että sinunkaltaiset idiootit uskoisivat heidän olevan syytön??  "Pedofiililla on monesti vielä tapana jotenkin syyllistää lasta tapahtumasta. " Näytäpä virallinen dokumentti jossa Michael syyttää lasta tapahtumasta?! Enpä ole moista vielä nähnyt... vanhemmat tässä ovat syyllisiä,ei lapsi. Tässä tapauksessa lapsen oma isäkin sanoo että äiti on "unstable", eikä usko syytteisiin pätkääkään.  "Sen he osaavat, joten siihen että Michael kiistää teon, ei ehkä kannata luottaa." No hyvä että itsekin tajusit, ettei kiistäminen vielä merkitse sitä että olisi teon tehnyt!!  "Todisteet puhuu puolestaan, samoin useat huhut vuosien varrella." Huonosti on sullakin pullat uunissa, itse olen kuullut huhuja että ahdistelet eläimiä. Kyllä minä nyt ennemmin huhuja uskon kuin faktoja... Äly hoi älä jätä... Kerrotko vielä mitä todisteita näistä jutuista on olemassa (ja lähteet mistä olet tiedon saanut), niis sit voidaan aloittaa ihan järkevä keskustelu aiheesta.  Ihan pienenä vinkkinä, jos tekstissäsi olisi pätkääkään faktaa niin sustakin sais fiksumman kuvan.

fin_test_477	Ministerit valehtelevat kansalle  http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2015112820745174_uu.shtml  Kuten kaikki varmasti tietävät, on suomessa tällä hetkellä historiansa huonoin hallitus. Valehtelun tahti on sitä luokkaa että voidaan asettaa kyseenalaiseksi koko hallitusohjelman tavoitteet. Stubb on "vähän" modaillut lukuja timpan ja jussin kanssa kun EK pyysi, luultavasti kohtalaista kompensaatiota vastaan, näin tekemään ja pakettia myydään kansalle ties millä yhteiskuntasopimuksen nimellä. Totuus taitaa olla se ettei mitää tuottavuushyppyjä ja palkkamaltteja tarvita, mutta jos näin ei käy, loppuu hallitukselle bonareiden tippuminen EKsta. Perustuslain 60 pykälä vaatii ministereiltä rehellisyyttä, mutta näin ei kyllä nykysuomessa ole asiat. Sen sijaan valehdellaan silmät suut täyteen minkä ehditään. Ja kukaan hallituksesta ei pistä tälle touhulle vastaan. Ei kokuumus, keput tai perssut. Vaikka perssuthan olivat viime vaalikaudella se äänekkäin moraalinvartija. Niin se vaan takki kääntyy, kun ministeriaudin ovet aukeaa...

Aina äänestän natoa ja natseja vastaan, lisää kustannuksia ei kansalle tarvita verojen ja maksujen korotusten muodossa entisten lisäksi. Nato hihhuleille kysymys, millonkas se Venäjä nyt sitten viimein Suomeen hyökkää, kun sitä on toitotettu jo viimeiset 10 vuotta, ja jotenkin koko teidän meuhkaamisesta on mennyt jo pohja, lähinnä huutelunne natosta on enää säälittävää sekä huvittavaa. Unohtamatta sitäkään tosiasi, että jos Venäjä hyökkääkin ja pistää hesan kivikaudelle, niin mitään ei oikeasti edes menetetä.

Kaikki nämä muutkin yli-nohevat jätkät pisti mieleen, oltiin asennossa niin nokka pystyssä että alikit ja muut pidättelivät naurua ja joskus naurun sekaisesti sanoivat että "noh, naama näkkärillehehe" kun tekivät ilmoituksia yms.

fin_test_488	Länsi-Savo lehtykäinen repäisi jälleen. Melkein toimittaja Tiina Knaappila(suvakki) kirjoitti lehtykäiseen suvakkiartikkelin. Yhteenotto Heinolan torilla missä mukana turvapaikanhakijoita.  Mutta seuraavssa tiivistyy Tiina Knaappilan suvaitsevainen tyhmyys, suorastaan idiotismi. Se oli ainut totuus että nämä partalapset(3 kpl) hyökkäsivät alaikäisten tyttöjen kimppuun joista yksi loukkaantui(17v). Samalla torilla yksi partalapsi koetti juottaa 12 vuotiasta lasta raiskauskuntoon.  Eikä tämä osaa ajatella että ne kaikki tytöt jotka joutuivat tavalla tai toisella partalasten uhreiksi ovat niitä jotka joutuivat kärsimään. Tiina Knaappilalta puuttuu täydellisesti empatiakyky koska on niin kiimassa partalapsista.

Useat esimiehethän ovat erittäin persoja perseennuolennalle. Työpaikan kiusaaja voi olla esimiehille eräänlainen jumala, joka hallitsee ja pompottaa esimiehiä mielensä mukaan ja esimiehet ovat käytännössä kiusaajan tai kiusaaja ryhmän sätkynukkeja.

fin_test_505	Urpilaisen metsärosvot  Urpilainen viittasi demarijohdon olevan metsärosvoja (Robin Hood & co). Niinhän ne melkein onkin. Oppositiota voi verrata metsään jossa nämä metsärosvot piileskelivät. Tekivät sieltä iskuja järjestäytynyttä yhteiskuntaa vastaan samalla tavoin kuin demarijohto nyt heittelee ruikutuksiaan oppositiosta. Mitään järkeä ei ruikutuksessa tarvi olla niin kuin ei yleensäkään kun demari on esittäjänä. Demarilla vaatimustason pitää aina olla matalampi niin kuin virkoihin ja suojatyöpaikkoihinkin. Nehän vois muuten jäädä työttömäksi tai ilman koulutuspaikkaa.  Pitäisi vain muistaa Urpilaisen ensin ottaa asioista selvää, ennen kuin vertaa itseänsä metsärosvoihin. Robin Hood ja muut metsärosvot kyllä varastivat rikkailta, mutta eivät he köyhillekään sitä jakaneet. Lainasivat pirunmoista korkoa vastaan niin kuin koronkiskurit yleensäkin.  Mutta hei. Sehän sopii hyvin kuvaan sillä demarithan polkee pienituloisia, köyhiä ja työttömiä jalkoihinsa niin kuin ei mitään. Mutta ei haittaa. Joku tyhmä näistäkin voi taas ensi vaaleissa erehtyä antamaan äänensä tälle rosvoporukalle.

fin_test_516	Vaikuttaisi siltä että kyseessä saattaa olla autoimmuunisairaus. Meillä oli ihan samantyyppistä vaikeutta, aina räjähti milloin mikäkin paikka tulehdukseen, ja koira allergisoitui nopeasti ruoka-aineille joita se ensin vaikutti sietävän. Ihosta lähetettiin koepalat patologian laitokselle, josta tuli vastauksena vaikea atopia. Autoimmuunisairauteen eläinlääkäri valmisti koiran omasta verestä seerumilääkkeen, jota sitten pantiin poskipussiin sellaisiin pieniin pampuloihin imeytettynä.  Kehottaisin sinua nyt vaihtamaan eläinlääkäriä, (hakemaan toisia näkokulmia) mikäli nykyinen neuvoo sinua vain pelkästään turvautumaan ruokien vaihteluun ja kirjoittelee antibiootteja. Koiran tilanne vaikuttaa niin hankalalta ja tuskaiselta että alkusyyt pitäisi saada selville, siellä nimittäin voi olla joku tämäntyyppinen juttu taustalla joka aiheuttaa sen että vastustuskykyä ei ole käytännössä ollenkaan, tai että koira sen nopeasti menettää altistuttuaan ärsykkeelle (tässä tapauksessa ruoka-aineille). Onnea matkaan!

Asioista on hyvä puhua suoraan poliittisesti korrektissa maailmassa.  Seksi ei ole normaali asia. Se kuuluu parisuhteeseen. Mitä enemmän naisella ollut kumppaneita sen suurempi taakka miehelle kunnioittaa naista. Niin se vaan menee, vai miksi naiset häpeävät seksikumppaniensa lukumäärää jos se kerran on ihan normaalia kuin hampaiden pesu?

fin_test_533	Seuraavassa puutun niihin, mitkä palstan näkökulmasta ovat relevantteja.  ”I NUMERO 1: RASISTEJA ON VAIN PIENI OSA KANSASTA.  Väärin. Rasisteja on 100%, sillä jokainen ihminen tekee havaintoja eri etnisten ryhmien kollektiivisista ominaisuuksista. Mikäli esim. mustat eivät olisi lainkaan erilaisia, miksi sitten hyysäri saarnaa monikulttuurisuudesta?”  *Mover*: Ei rasismia ole erilaisuuden havainnointi, vaan rasistisuus. Siihen syyllistyy – onneksi – vain pieni osa väestöstä.  ”MYYTTI NUMERO 2: RASISTIT OVAT PIKKUPOIKIA, SYRJÄYTNEITÄ TAI IDIOOTTEJA.  Väärin. Ne, jotka tunnustautuvat rasisteiksi edustavat jotakuinkin läpileikkausta kansasta. Heitä on miehiä ja naisia, lääkäreitä, putkiasentajia, tohtoreita, autonkuljettajia, johtajia, leipureita, presidenttejä, taiteilijoita, hippejä, osastopäälliköitä... koska hyysärien äänekäs ja asiaton propaganda on niin laajalle levinnyttä, on rasisteilla joidenkin silmissä huono maine, joten erityisesti sosiaalisessa arvoasemassa korkealla olevat usein pidättäytyvät ilmaisemasta rasistisia kantojaan - joita heillä toki on.”  *Mover*: On totta, että rasisteja on monissa ihmisryhmissä. Mutta enimmäkseen he ovat korkeintaan vähäisen koulutuksen saaneita.  ”MYYTTI NUMERO 3: RASISMI JOHTAA VÄKIVALTAAN.  Väärin. Todellisuudessa rasismi ehkäisee väkivaltaa pyrkiessään pitämään toisiinsa sopeutumattomat kulttuurit erillään. Sitäpaitsi rasismi on vain neutraali kyky tehdä kulttuurillisia havaintoja ja tunnustaa ihmisryhmien erilaisuus.”  *Mover*: Rasismi on väkivaltaa – henkistä tai ruumiillista.  ”MYYTTI NUMERO 4: RASISTI PELKÄÄ ERILAISUUTTA.  Väärin. Rasisti päinvastoin kunnioittaa erilaisuutta ja toimii erilaisten kulttuurien säilyttämiseksi pitämällä kulttuurit erillään ja näin vaalimalla niiden omintakeisuutta ja oikeutta omiin tapoihinsa. Hyysäri taas pelkää kaikkea erilaista ja siksi haluaa tuhota kaikki maailman kulttuurit luodakseen yhden globaalin monokulttuurin, joka on kaikkialla maapallolla samanlainen.”  *Mover*: Kunnioitusta ei ole halu estää keinotekoisesti kanssakäyminen.  ”MYYTTI NUMERO 5: ROTUJA EI OLE.  Väärin. Rotu on ensinnäkin käsite. Kaikki käsitteet ovat ihmisen luomia ja niiden sisältö on näin ihmisen itsensä määriteltävissä. Luonnossa ei sinänsä ole mitään rajoja tai luokkia, koska luonnossa ei ole mitään tällaisia rajoja luovaa SUBJEKTIA. Eläinrotuja katsotaan olevan, vaikka usein kaksi eläintä muistuttaa toisiaan enemmän kuin vaikkapa valkoinen ja musta ihminen toisiaan. Rotujen olemassaolon kieltäminen on paitsi geneettistä harhaoppia ja arkipäivän kokemuksen vastainen, myös joutavaa poliittisesti korrektiutta tavoittelevaa liirumlaarumia, jolla vain yritetään olla sanomatta mitään, mikä voisi tuoda esille kiusallisia tosiasioita.”  *Mover*: Tässä nyt kirjoittaja väittää yhtä ja perustelee toista. Joka tapauksessa - rotujen olemassaololla ei ole mitään tekemistä rasistisuuden kanssa.  ”MYYTTI NUMERO 6: IHMISRYHMIEN ÄLYSSÄ EI OLE EROJA.  Väärin. Jo Jeesus sanoi, että "hedelmistään puu tunnetaan". Paitsi tutkimukset älykkyysosamääristä, myös vilkaisu esim. Afrikkaan osoittaa, että ihmisryhmien kollektiivisissa henkisissä kyvyissä on todellakin MERKITTÄVIÄ keskinäisiä eroja. Kuitenkin jokin musta yksilö saattaa olla älykkäämpi kuin jokin tietty valkoinen, mutta suurien joukkojen tasolla valkoinen on ylivertainen.”  *Mover*: Ihmisryhmien mahdollisella älykkyyserolla ei ole mitään tekemistä rasistisuuden kanssa.  ”MYYTTI NUMERO 7: MUSTAT SOPEUTUVAT KULTTUURIIMME.  Väärin. Kaikkialla lännessä mustat ovat yliedustettuina työttömien ja lusijoiden joukossa. Esim. Britanniassa valkoisia ja aasialaisia istuu vankiloissa vähemmän kuin heidän määränsä populaatiossa antaisi olettaa, ja mustia taas noin 7 kertaa enemmän. USA:ssa mustista äideistä 45% on yksinhuoltajia ja trendi on vain kasvussa.”  *Mover*:Kaikki sosiaaliset ilmiöt ovat suhteellisia – eivätkö mustavalkoisia.  "MYYTTI NUMERO 10: POLYKULTTUURISUUS ON PAREMPI KUIN MONOKULTTUURISUUS.  Väärin. Jos erilaisen kulttuurin omaavat ihmiset ovat suurin joukoin tekemisissä keskenään, syntyy väistämättä myös konflikteja. Monokulttuuri voi olla myös voimavara, eikä kritiikitön sekametelisoppakulttuuri ole automaattisesti paras - sen ovat uutiset maailmalta ja Suomesta meille osoittaneet."  *Mover*: Sen enempää poly- kuin monokulttuurisuuskaan ei ole itseisarvo – mutta kumpikin on toimiva ja mahdollinen.  ”MYYTTI NUMERO 12: VAIN VALKOISET OVAT RASISTEJA.  Väärin. Humanistinen perinne ja yleinen suvaitsevaisuus demokratian ohella pitävät huolen siitä, että länsimailla ei tuoda rasismia läheskään niin selkeästi esiin kuin esim. Afrikassa, jossa valkoisia maanviljelijöitä tapetaan ihonvärinsä vuoksi ja toiseen heimoon kuuluvia kiduttaa.”  *Mover*: Tämä – jos sitä joku nyt on yleensä esittänyt – on tietenkin myytti.  "MYYTTI NUMERO 14: AFRIKKAA VOIDAAN AUTTAA OTTAMALLA PAKOLAISIA.  Väärin. Se vain kurjistaa Afrikan tilannetta, sillä näin yleensä työikäiset miehet, jotka voisivat rakentaa maataan, lähtevät länteen ja jättävät naiset ja lapset kuolemaan sodan ja nälän jalkoihin. Lisäksi afrikkalaiset uskaltavat turvallisimmin mielin hyökätä naapuriheimon kimppuun, kun voivat alakynteen jäädessään lähteä esim. Suomeen sotapakolaisina. Afrikka tarvitsisi kipeästi niitä koulutettuja mustia, jotka ovat saaneet oppinsa länsimailla."  *Mover*: Yksittäisiä ihmisiä voidaan auttaa ottamalla pakolaisia. Hätä on ensisijainen kriteeri, sitten tulevat muut.  "MYYTTI NUMERO 15: MEILLÄ ON MORAALINEN VELVOLLISUUS MAKSAA KEHITYSAPUA.  Väärin. Suomi ei ole ollut Afrikassa siirtomaaherrana. Toisekseen Afrikka on luonnonvaroiltaan rikkauden ylitsevuotava suurvalta köyhän Suomen rinnalla - meillä on vain tukkipuuta ja talvisin lunta. Jos varallisuus olisi mittarina, Afrikka tukisi joka vuosi Suomea merkittävillä summilla."  *Mover*: Moraali ei vaadi vastiketta.

fin_test_536	Homous ja lespous ovat yksilön sairaita valintoja.  Yhteiskunta on sairas. kun se hyväksyy nuo sairaat valinnat.

fin_test_537	Homoja on parannettu kautta aikojen leikkaamalla pallit pois. Homoista tulee tällöin lempeitä eunukkeja vailla seksuaalisia himoja. Homon tyypillinen naismainen ääni kohoaa vieläkin korkeammaksi kimitykseksi.

fin_test_542	Totta on, että vähemmistönä ollaan oltu varmaan koko foorumin olemassaolon ajan. Jakuten aloittaja totesi, homoudessa on tulevaisuus. Toivon, että kun 20-30 vuoden päästä ihminen laskeutuu Marsin pinnalle ovat nämä urhoot kokeneita homomiehiä ja julistavat uuden planeetan homojen planeetaksi. Tulevaisuudessa Mars asutetaan 100% homoilla ja kuten aloittaja meinasi, tarvittaessa joitain valioyksilö naisia säilytetään steriilikopeissa. Joka tapauksessa yriteään päästä heteroudesta eroon mahdollisimman pian maapallon pelastamiseksi. Käsittääkseni homot eivät myöskään ole kovin sotaisaa kansaa.

Vaikket itse kertomuksen naisen avuja, ulkonäköä ja luonnetta omaisikaan, niin turha sinun täällä on purkaa katkeruuttasi siitä, että joku suomalainen mies on päässyt häneen tutustumaan. Etkö soisi miehelle edes kerran todellista onnea elämässään?  Minusta on hieno juttu, että suomalaiset miehet tutustuvat naisiin toisista kulttuureista, jotka osaavat kohdella miestä miehenä. Tällaista naista minäkin kohtelen mielellään NAISENA ja jopa mielellään teen hänelle palveluksia ja suojelen häntä.

Sensijaan kuukausittain käy iso mustalaislauma aiheuttamassa hirveän härdelin, kun he poistuvat liikkeestä huomataan taas ison määrän tavaroita kadonneeksi. Tätä tapahtuu minulle ja tuntemieni yrittäjien liikkeille kokoajan. Minulta on urani aikana varastettu mustalaisten toimesta hienon omakotitalon verran tavaraa. Tule sieltä sveitsistäsi vaikka kuukaudeksi töihin isoon kauppaan Suomessa ja näe tämä mustalaisten varastelu. Tule sitten kyselemään onko sulla joku ongelma!

Mielestänne saatte esim. heittää katukivillä poliisia mutta jos teidät otetaan siitä kiinni niin se sitten väärin?  Mellakointi ei ole demokratiaa vaan nyrkkivaltaa.

fin_test_615	Kävin tänään testaamassa 206 XS HDI:n, mukava pikkuauto. Kyllä tollanen pitäs saaha. Auto oli ollut 4 päivää pakkasessa eikä lämmityksessä ja minä menin ja starttasin -20C pakkasessa ja hyvin lähti käyntiin... jäi moni auto sutimaan liikennevaloihin, mutta 206 hdi:llä mentiin jo kaukana. 1 vähän liikkeelle heti kakkosta, sit kolmosta ja voi sitä menoa... YES ! Liikaa ei kannata HDI:tä kierrättä sillä siitä ei ole mitään hyötyä. Istuimet olivat hyvät ja kun tuota niskatukeakin nyt sai säädettyä eteen ja taakse, mukava penkki. Moottorin lämmöt ei paljoa nousseet -20C pakkasella, olikohan 80C, mutta lämpöä tuo pukkasi ihan ok johtuen niistä sähkölämmittimistä. Ajettavuus oli hyvä, jäi hyvä mieli koeajosta.

Se oli ollu yötä sen mummolla eikä se saa koskaan tulemaan siellä, kun se on jotenkin niin hieno paikka ja vessassa huono äänieristys. Hetken päästä se itki ihan punasena, että tuli kauhee paska housuun! Muistan miltä tuntui 6-vuotiaana kauppareissulla, kun oli tehtävä se iso pötkö housuun ja voin kuvitella miltä sama tuntuis aikuisena. Plöröt on eri juttu, se vaan lörähtää, mutta pökälöinti todella tuntuu. Aikuinen nainen rintoineen ja pyllyineen, ja pääsee isot kakkapökäleet housuun. Se todella hävettää.

fin_test_666	israelilainen urheus  Aika naurettavaa tuo Israelin "urhojen" pelehtiminen. Pullapojat kituuttaa satoja viattomia palestiinalaisia siviilejä, naisia ja lapsia, kurjissa oloissa vankiloissa, samalla kun vaativat yhtä ainoaa sotavankia takaisin käyttäen kollektiivistä kiristystä viattomaan kansanosaan.  Paineet hallitusta kohtaan ovat Israelissa varmasti kovat, kun yksi sotilasrukka ei ole saapunut äidin hellan ääreen kosheria maistelemaan. Ei muuta kuin ampumaan USAn toimittamilla tykeillä naisia ja lapsia riekaleiksi paksun betonimuurin takaa. Samalla raukkamaiset lastenmurhaajat muistuttavat, että sotilaan vahingoittaminen tietäisi taivaan tippumista niskaan. Ilmeisesti tämäkin tapahtuisi israelilaisen "sankarillisesti" tuhoamalla "vihollinen" (siis naiset ja lapset) risteilyohjuksin, ilman, että sotilaalta katkeaisi kynttäkään.  On ihan oikein, että saavat maistaa sitä päivittäistä huolta ja tuskaa, jota ovat jo kymmenien vuosien ajan tuottaneet palestiinalaisille äideille. Valitettavasti tämä sotilasparasta koettu tuska on vain murto-osa siitä. Juutalainen "urheus" saa tässä kyllä antaisemansa leiman, jälleen.

fin_test_668	Tampere on köyhien kaupunki  Tampereella asuu kaikki suomen köyhät, laittaa vain toriin ilmoituksen, että myyn 20-100e itselle tarpeetonta, niin kukaan ei soita. 90% ajaa osamaksu autolla, ruoka ostetaan kulutusluotolla kuukausi etukäteen, huonekalut, kodinkoneet,älykännykän saa 3,00e kk maksaa ja vuokra viedään tilistä, niin eihän kellään ole 20e taskussa, vain se muoviläpyskä, jolla ei saa seinästä rahaa, mutta kaupan kassa hyväksyy velaksi ostamisen. Miten pormestarit ajatteli myydä uudet asunnot ja kenelle? Liike ja toimistotilaa tehdään lisää, vaikka 100 000 neliötä on tyhjänä, mitä varten? Ei Tampere elä pelkällä ratikalla, pakolaisilla, pizzanmyynnillä ja niillä sadoilla kaljapaikoilla, urheilulla? Tänne täytyy saada vientiteollisuutta, mutta tehtaat on tuhottu ja työpaikat siirtynyt ympäristökuntiin. Ennen keskustassa oli 20 000 teollista työpaikkaa ja työmatkatkaliikenne toimi busseilla, ei ollut ruuhkia? Nyt on tunneleita, ohitusteitä, tulee ratikka, mitä varten, kun bussit joustaa, mutta ratikka ei. Ja, ketä varten, keskusta on kuollut lähiö, jossa ei ole enään tuottavaa työtä, mutta eläkeläisiä, narkkareita ja työttömiä 20 000? Hyvin hoidettu johtaminen , näin ne naiset hoitaa kaupungin velkaiseksi ja siitä joutuu kärsimään vanhukset, työttömät ja meidän lapsetkin vielä 30 vuotta. Hölmöläisten kaupunki, kun äänestetään porvareita, me työläisten lapset. Mitä voi kaupunkilaisilta vaatia, kun joka kylässä poljetaan pyörää sisähallissa ja vielä maksetaan siitä, hölmö joka maksaa. Kun tulee kesä, niin juoskaa siellä sisällä, älkääkä tulko aurinkoon, eikö siellä ole omat valot sisällä ja peili, mistä ihailla itseään.

(Vrt. kun poliisi puhui möykkääville nuorille vain suomea ja nämö vaativat saman ruotsiksi)  Kommentit:  valitettava tosiasia tämä on, pisatuloksissa kävi ilmi että hurrit ovat lähes yhtä typeriä kuin afrikkalaiset. kun taas suomalaiset ovat maailman parhaita.  Kyllä ovat. Suomenruotsalaisella logiikalla 5% vähemmistön ei tarvitse osata maan pääkieltä, mutta loppujen 95 prosentin pitää kyllä osata ruotsia.  Suomenruotsalainen menee ihan hämilleen kun näkee poliisiauton, jossa lukee "POLIISI". Pitkään miettii ja ihmettelee, että mikä kumma tuo oikein on.

Lisäsin painetta vähitellen ja sain painettua sen "läpi". Peniksen pää kulki sitten helposti suun ja kurkun väliä.  Se ei ees tuottanu ongelmia ja olin yllättyny. Tosin en ole koskaan saanut oksennettua työntämällä sormet kurkkuun... eli kai se on fysiikastakin kiinni. Hengittää en kuitenkaan voi silloin kun se on kurkun puolella..  -W-

fin_test_785	Väität, että saat Yksityisten alojen työttömyyskassasta samat edut, kuin ammattiliitosta. Väitteesi ei pidä alkuunkaan paikkaansa. Ensinnäkään Yksityisten alojen työttömyyskassa ei ole mikään liitto, vaan pelkästään työttömyyskorvauksen maksaja minimipalvelulla. Edunvalvontaasi liittyviä palveluja sieltä et saa, koska sopimukset solmii ja työehtojen toteutumista valvoo alan ammattiliitto. Ammattiliitoilta saat myös asiamies- ja lakimiespalveluja. Todennäköisesti olet joku tietoisesti provosoija, mutta jos olet todella noin tyhmä, niin sinua ja sinunlaisiasi työnantajat kusettavat pahimmin. Sellaista on helppo kusettaa, joka luulee tietävänsä kaiken, mutta itseasiassa ei tiedä juuri mitään. Tyhmyyttäsi ja tietämättömyyttäsi osoittaa myös se, että kuvittelet asian olevan sillä selvä, että TES: si on luettavanasi. TES:sien tulkinta on aivan oma lajinsa ja yhdellä tulkinnalla saattaa tulla kerralla koko vuoden liiton jäsenmaksua vastaava rahamäärä työntekijälle. Mitä siihen sinun hulluuteesi tulee, niin se sinun täytyy selvittää jossakin yhteiskunnan ylläpitämässä laitoksessa. Siinä edes ammattiliitto ei sinua voi auttaa. Ammattiliitot tosin edistävät kyseisten laitosten toimintaa sillä, että ne ulosmittaavat ahneelta kansainväliseltä pääomalta verotuloja, joilla rahoitetaan mm. kyseisten laitosten toimintaa. En ota tässä kantaa sinun luettelemiisi genitaalitermeihin. Pyydä selvittämään siellä hoitolaitoksessa, miksi ne kuuluvat niin viljalti sinun sanavarastoosi.

ger_test_845	@stupmed @BMauschen ebendrum. Der Benchmark, wann das Thema überhaupt relevant wird, liegt sehr hoch.   Dass Querdenker Angst davor haben, lässt sich m.E. nur mit magischem Denken erklären. Wer glaubt, dass Arnika D30 irgendeine Wirkung hätte, glaubt vielleicht auch an Shedding.

Und der mit dem Namen "Team_Reality" macht sich nicht mal die Mühe, herauszufinden, worum es geht. Liest die Übetschrift und "denkt" sich: "die will Zensur!" So sind Bildzeitungsleser konditioniert!
ger_test_1232	Möchte nicht von so einem Asshole wie dem Merz auch nur ansatzweise mitregiert werden.  Bin jetzt nach 30 Jahren erstmals wieder bereit für etwas zu demonstrieren, nur leider ist das gerade nicht opportun :-|
ger_test_1233	@Keineausrede Die CDU als grüner Blinddarm.  erbärmlich eine konservative Chance so zu verpassen und mit der AfD zusammenzuarbeiten
ger_test_1234	@DoroStein @Markus_Soeder Da haben Sie was gründlich missverstanden: die Fachleute sind sich einig, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass 2 x Geimpfte sich anstecken, sehr gering ist (Biontech schützt zB zu 95%) u. damit sind sie auch genauso wenig ansteckend. Ich weiß ja nicht, wo Sie Ihren Schmarrn herhaben
ger_test_1235	@ainyrockstar @Inselkind16 Du hast mit fast allem recht.  Aber "bleibt ein Krimineller" impliziert, dass dir irgendein Idiot minutenlang auf den Hals steigen darf, bis du verreckst - weil du ja kriminell bist.  Was die BLM Vollpfosten draus gemacht haben ist eine andere Sache.  Aber falsch bleibt falsch.
ger_test_1236	@DTKB6 @ronca89097645 @shoutingcassy @dutschman @ABaerbock Hm, vielleicht weil aus keiner der Modellierungen positive Effekte herausgekommen sind, bzw. die negativen Effekte immer überwiegen.
ger_test_1237	@_m_o_ni @2GRIMREAPER3 @schripinsky @nurcan_nury @quarkswdr Willst du jetzt etwa behaupten das Querdenker irgendetwas außer totalen Geistigen Müll zu Tage fördern.  Schau mal unter die Tweets von Herrn Lauterbach. So viel Müll sieht nichtmal ein Müllmann in New York an einem Tag.
ger_test_1238	@VeryFreshDrafts @MartinSebas8 @watwillse @ZentralratJuden @ulfposh Man kann ideologien nicht importieren, schon gar nicht wenn sie in der Bevölkerung tief verwurzelt sind
ger_test_1239	@hartaberfair @DasErste @ToniHofreiter #BaerbockvsHabeck  Wie kann eine Partei so dumm sein, die UNERTRÄGLICH schrille nervende Stimme von  @ABaerbock der wohltemperierten sympathischen von Habeck vorzuziehen. Die Baerbock wird beim Wahlvolk so gut ankommen, wie Kommentatorin Claudia Neumann bei den Männerfußballfans.
ger_test_1240	@Crosshead16 @SteffenSchlager @Karl_Lauterbach Nein das zeigt einfach wie unzuverlässig diese Tests sind. Aber davon abgesehen kam immernoch kein Argument.
ger_test_1241	@sunnytimes45 2/2 Querdenker demos generell verbieten nicht vergessen. Die tausenden idioten tragen auch nicht grad fördernd bei
ger_test_1242	@MichaelKalke2 naja. Ich finde den Organisator von Querdenker bissel fragwürdig. Immer gleiche Stelle am Brandenburger Tor, dann kommt die Polizei usw usw. sieht mir alles sehr gesteuert aus.
ger_test_1243	@joachimlampeitl @RealHeckTicker @AndreasKlitzsch @welt Also "Kopftuchmädchen" und vor allem auch "Taugenichtse" ist ganz klar Nazi Geheimcode so wie ihn auch Maassen benutzt! Bei "Messermänner" ist die Sache sonnenklar! Alter SS Jargon! Ja und "Schwuchtel" war ja Hitlers Lieblingswort!
ger_test_1244	@migrantifa 🤡 liberale Mitte unter sich. Wette, mit fcknazi Hashtag in der Bio 😌✨
ger_test_1245	Ich hab gestern Abend #AnneWill NICHT gesehen, ich saß mit einer kühlen Flasche Pils auf meiner Terrasse. Auch mal schön, so ohne Betablocker und den geistigen Dünnschiss der verwöhnten Reemtsma-Rotzgöre #Neubauer. Habt alle einen schönen Tag! 🙋‍♂️
ger_test_1246	@Xrxtn @Alice_Weidel @UweJunge Wer bestimmt das? Sie? 😂
ger_test_1247	@OpaPaulsEnkelin @Fiver_Galaxy @georgrestle Du weißt schon was ad hominem bedeutet oder?😅
ger_test_1248	Wtf, dude?  Ich hab jetzt nicht allzu große Lust nen Schwanz zu lutschen, ihr?  #LGBTQ #feminismus #gay https://t.co/863ziax4Vm
ger_test_1249	@Birgit_Kelle Und die nächste Heulboje steht bereit für´s Kanzleramt, na Mahlzeit! Und nein, mit dem Geschlecht hat das nichts zu tun. Selbst Merkel hätte nicht so dumm reagiert!
ger_test_1250	@Karl_Lauterbach Wer an mein Fleisch will, ist für mich auch nicht wählbar. Ist zwar unpopulär. Ist aber so.
ger_test_1251	@StefanBachman13 @trebbianos @FrReschke @ZDFheute @ZDF @ARD_Presse Attila Hildmann ist dumm, hetzerisch und unreflektiert - das was er sagt ist geistiger Abfall.   Reicht das?   Dürfen wir jetzt wieder zum Thema diskutieren oder willst du noch ein wenig die Querdenker / Hildmann Schublade geöffnet lassen?
ger_test_1252	@tagesschau "Söder - der gestärkte Verlierer"   Und Laschet der geschwächte Gewinner?  Offenkundig werden sämtliche Gewinne aus Maskendeals&amp;Co direkt in die Propagandaabteilungen reinvestiert.  OOooooohhh, sind die suess...
ger_test_1253	@ABaerbock Was halten Sie denn davon, Extremismus in Gänze zu bekämpfen? Nicht so wirklich viel, nicht wahr?
ger_test_1254	@schwurbelwatch Der hat echt ordentlich eins an der Waffel. Aber die Querdenker werden dann die nächste Sau durchs Dorf jagen und uns auf den Sack gehen, nachdem sie jetzt gemerkt haben, wieviel "Erwachte" es mittlerweile gibt.
ger_test_1255	@Afelia @ABaerbock Fürchte, dass es einigen Parteien ganz recht ist, weiblichen Nachwuchs abzuschrecken. So können sie sich auch in 10 Jahren noch rausreden mit „die Frauen wollen halt nicht“.
ger_test_1256	@FFF_Frankfurt Ich würde euren Eltern das Haus, das Auto, den Hund und den Erziehungsauftrag wegnehmen, ihr linksradikalen Fotzen. #V8dasmachtKrachinderNacht
ger_test_1257	@watwillse @ZentralratJuden @ulfposh wie damals aus Österreich?
ger_test_1258	Gestern war mein ganzer Bezirk wieder voller Querdenker und Nazis. Anwohner müssen sich zuhause verstecken, weil sich idioten zum scheisse bauen in Berlin verabredet haben.  #b2104
ger_test_1259	@Bulldozer241 @leipzig04349 @WagenMehr @Karl_Lauterbach Wem wird das Recht auf körperliche Unversehrtheit abgesprochen?
ger_test_1260	@Lutz2427 @Hans456789 @Karl_Lauterbach Ist es nicht erschreckend was für Psycholophaten frei herum laufen und die treten in Rudeln auf. Ich befürchte nach der Krise ist vor der Krise, die muss man doch endlich unterbringen und behandeln. Am besten in Sicherheitsverwshrung bevor sie los laufen und Geimpfte, Ärzte und 2
ger_test_1261	@donphilippo @Beatrix_vStorch Ihr Unsinn ist die beste Art der Werbung, natürlich wird jetzt erst recht AfD gewählt, immer, und im übrigen: Reconquista wird kommen (bald)!
ger_test_1262	Hm glaube nicht, dass die eine gute Wahl war. Für mich ist die Option Grün damit leider vom Tisch. Aber wünsche ihr trotzdem viel Erfolg. Hauptsache nicht mehr cdu csu!  #Baerbock
ger_test_1263	@greenpeace_de Ständig werden die unzähligen toten, vertriebenen oder um ihre Lebensgrundlage beraubten Menschen ignoriert, denen die Klimakatastrophe keine Zukunft lässt. Die Hasswelle gegen eure kritikwürdige, aber mutige Aktion ist reine Heuchelei! Heute habt ihr unsere Solidarität.
ger_test_1264	Wir sollten uns in Acht nehmen! Ich habe Insiderinformationen erhalten, dass aus Asien gefährliche Yarrak-viren unterwegs sind.  Diese sollen verheerende Folgen haben!  #Covid19 #Covid #LongCovidKids #vaccine #covidmyass   #covidvaccine
ger_test_1265	@a_nnaschneider Es ist nicht notwendig dass sie sich absichtlich dumm stellen. Sie und ich wissen dass es sich um eine ganz normale twitter polemik handelt um Merz den Spiegel vorzuhalten. Plustern sie nicht jeden Furz unnötig auf nur um billige Likes von Telegram Deppen abzusahnen.
ger_test_1266	@MikiIsHere @ZDFheute Das ist einfach polemische Scheisse. Ihr armen linken Opfer.Selbst wenn es sein fucking Job ist, ist er auch nur ein Mensch und verdient Respekt.Dein fucking Job bei einer Demo ist, sich vernünftig zu verhalten. Aber das hat man euch nie beigebracht.
ger_test_1267	@PetjePuck @LibertyLucas26 @greenpeace_de Sind keine Verbrechen, sondern debattierbare Aktionen.  Gilt aber auch für den Mob wie Putin- oder Orbán-Jugend, der Bürgerrechtskultur mit Hass bekämpft und dafür Freiheit &amp; Liberalismus kapert wie Nationalsozialisten die damals noch nicht abgewirtschaftete Idee vom Sozialismus.
ger_test_1268	@str01ner @Alice_Weidel @Karl_Lauterbach @helgelindh Ach guck an, die linksradikalen Trolle kriechen auch schon wieder hier rum.
ger_test_1269	@Corn_lxy @janboehm Das Hinzugewonnene kommt direkt von der AfD,hat ja geklappt mit dem Joker Maaßen, insofern ist Laschet doch genau so bauernschlau wie er rüberkommt u idealer KaKa für diese rechte Partei.Was mit dem Klima passiert,weiss nun auch jede/r:Lieber Planet als CDU zerstören!
ger_test_1270	@FFF_Frankfurt Hat irgendjemand von euch Ökofuzzis auch nur einmal etwas erreicht im Leben? Nein. Und dann wollt ihr andern vorschreiben, wie sie zu leben haben? Was für ein Abschaum ihr doch seid.
ger_test_1271	@Julia_ablr @VWGroup @volkswagen Die Aktivist:innen haben in Emden nichts gestohlen. Sie haben gegen die Zerstörung ihre Zukunft demonstriert. Das haben sie auf drastische Weise getan, indem sie vorrübergehend Schlüssel von Diesel und Benzinern sichergestellt haben.
ger_test_1272	@leserschwert @reitschuster Nö, es ist eine Impfung. Die Art die Info in die Zellen zu schleussen ist nur neu. Es bleibt trotzdem eine Impfung.
ger_test_1273	@cobvl Alles im allem aber natürlich harmloser als man nach den ersten Reaktionen hier den Eindruck bekommt. Mich holen die Videos nicht wirklich ab, kann den Zynismus aber aushalten ohne die Querdenker und "Verharmlosung von Toten!"-Keule auszupacken.
ger_test_1274	@JNynaeve @passschaerfe6 @Beatrix_vStorch @JNynaeve Ja klar, wenn ich auf Comedy und Schwachsinn stehe ist die AfD eine sichere Bank
ger_test_1275	@ralfsr @HWForster1 Lustig, werfe ich Dir das mit der Bildung an den Kopf, so wird gefragt, woher man es wissen würde, aber selbst mit so einem Mumpitz am Anfang ankommen.. Ach ja, daß zeigt, wo die “Bildung“ sitzt. Im Kopf zumindest nicht, so viel ist sicher.

ger_test_1278	@schnellenbachj überragendem CSU-Ergebnis theoretisch für die Kanzlerschaft. Es zeichnet sich ab, dass Laschet von der Fraktion nicht getragen würde. Er muss abdanken und mit dem Hinweis dass das Amt des Kanzlerkandidaten ja ein inoffizielles sei, führt plötzlich Söder Koalitionsverhandlungen.
ger_test_1279	@Wulfbk @kts24news @ntvde Dir fehlt der rote Punkt der antifa Trolle aus dem Kindergarten. aber macht nichts die Blacklist wartet auch auf Dich. Die größten Massenmörder waren halt alles Linksfaschisten!
ger_test_1280	@danny_wilmore @HWForster1 Bisschen mehr Ahnung für anschließende Meinungsbildung würde Ihnen auch ganz gut tun. Mit Kommentaren wie Ihrem, disqualifiziert man sich grundsätzlich selbst - ohne Ausnahme.
ger_test_1281	@FreyrSiegfried @ASTS1972 @StBrandner Im Gegensatz zu Ihnen verstehe ich auch das was die verschiedenen demokratischen Parteien sagen und achte nicht nur darauf wer klatscht. Ihr "Kern" ist im Gegensatz zur #afd,  im Rahmen unserer Verfassung. #noafd #fckafd
ger_test_1282	@Alice_Weidel @UweJunge Die Kommentare hier, drüben bei FB und auf allen anderen Kanälen, zeigen deutlich, dass das eben ganz genau die AfD ist. Ihre Wähler sind der intellektuelle Bodensatz unserer Gesellschaft. Das kann ich anhand jedes einzelnen Profils, Eurer Wähler, millionenfach beweisen.

Wir sollten uns aber lieber sachlich mit Inhalten auseinandersetzen und uns nicht an Personen abarbeiten. Außerdem steht es jedem frei sämtliche Medien zu konsumieren. Danach zählt das beste Argument.
ger_test_1286	Es gibt in jedem Kulturkreis Vollidioten. Aber dass die Frauenfeindlichkeit bei den Moslems um ein Vielfaches höher ist, das streiten Sie wohl nicht ab. Der Vollkoffer in Wien war ein Ägypter und egal ob Moslem oder nicht. In Albanien und im Kosovo gleich.
ger_test_1287	@jstnkoe @empoere_dich @Spitfireeeee_v @davidbest95 @greenpeace_de nun, das machen Sie "Justin" praktisch jeden Tag, wenn Sie in Ihren Plastik-VW einsteigen und Ihr Verbrennerle zünden ..
ger_test_1288	Selbst der RND schreibt jetzt über die unbegründeten Horrorprognosen von Lauterbach, RKI und Verkehrsplanern und das #B117 Kindermärchen.  Das konnten Sie bei mir schon alles vor zwei Monaten lesen.  https://t.co/1iWJG9dzDf
ger_test_1289	@Volksverpetzer Spenden Sie jetzt für die Revolution!  Das kommt nicht mehr wieder!  Mein Vorschlag wäre ja: da sich diese Querdenker ja in einer Diktatur sehen, sollten sie auch mal wie in einer Diktatur behandelt werden. Und wenn es nur für einen Tag ist.
ger_test_1290	@nuclearpostman @ILyrikerclub @rachelk44138983 @Kugelblitzdemo2 @welt Deshalb gab es die selben Rollen z.B. auch im alten chinesischen Kaiserreich und solche Strukturen existieren auch heute noch in afrikanischen Stammesdörfern.  Alles hat dieser böse weiße Mann geschaffen.

ger_test_1292	@Karl_Lauterbach Ich impfe alle ab 12Jährigen in der Praxis nach gründlicher Aufklärung. Leider erhalten wir nur 12 Impfdosen pro Woche, und die Warteliste der Impfwilligen ist lang. Nach den Kindern mit Risikofaktoren werden wir alle nach Reihenfolge impfen, die wollen.
ger_test_1293	@Beatrix_vStorch Schäbige Populistin (immer noch), die eine schreckliche Tat missbraucht (wieder), um pauschal gegen eine ganze Gruppe zu hetzen (immer). Auch wenn es in #Corona-Zeiten untergeht: wer AfD wählt, wählt Nazis
ger_test_1294	Alter.. ich bin so ner Liste gefolgt um ein bisschen in die Jura-Bubble zu kommen. Jetzt habe ich dauernd so widerliche Querdenker-Tweets in der Timeline, die mich jedes mal einfach nur zum Kotzen bringen...

ger_test_1302	@thorbi_nrw @NicolasZimmer @CDU Auch Hitler wurde demokratisch gewählt! Wie armselig, we so geistigem Dünnschiss abläßt! Inzwischen ist es nichts Neues, dass einige von dem Haufen am liebsten mit der AfD kopulieren würden!

ger_test_1309	@AndreasKlitzsch @welt Wen meinen Sie mit 90 % , die Wähler oder Wahlberechtigten ?
ger_test_1310	@Strahlemann9 sorry, ich sehe radikale massiv bewaffnete zu allem bereite  Nazis, die sich als friedliebende Bürger tarnen die nichts mehr wollen als einfach ihre vom Grundgesetz verankerte Rechte wieder zu bekommen. Alles Wölfe im Schafspelz.

ger_test_2825	@AlexWallasch @solongur @reitschuster Mich stört, dass sie ihre Frage schon gleich mit einer Beleidigung einleiten. Jeder hat das Recht auf Respekt, Anstand und Höflichkeit, H.

ger_test_2854	@ErwinSchmidbau4 @janboehm Also am besten sich in seiner Wohnung verbarrikadieren es könnte ja überall ein Terrorist sein?
ger_test_2855	@Karl_Lauterbach Wo waren Sie, als es darum ging, in vorausschauender Weise deutlich mehr Impfstoff (wie Trump oder Boris Johnson) zu bestellen? Warum haben Sie damals nicht Alarm geschlagen? Dann hätten wir das ganze Problem jetzt nicht.
ger_test_2856	@reitschuster Ich habe auch schon über Auswanderung nachgedacht. Aber wo ist es wirklich besser als hier. Was nützt schöneres Wetter, geringere Abgaben und Kosten, wenn z.B. das Gesundheitssystem nichts taugt.  Zur Zeit habe ich das Idealziel noch nicht gefunden.
ger_test_2857	@GirkeHanjo Wie Sie von dem Themenkomplex jetzt auf Antisemitismus kommen ist ein fürwahr beeindruckender Gedankensprung. Und Pfleger:innen die von der Bild und Welt völlig faktenfrei vorgehalten bekommen, sie würden nur rumjammern dürfen sich doch ruhig mal wehren, oder?
ger_test_2858	@herr_sin @Karl_Lauterbach @Alice_Weidel Öhm, nein, Frau Weidel versteuert in Deutschland! .....übrigens uraltes Thema, 100x wiederlegt, das Sie das nicht wissen ist ziemlich armselig für jemanden der sich politisch äussert.

ger_test_2869	@Laforce_61 @WagenMehr @Karl_Lauterbach Man merkt, dass du auch nu in die Nähe einer Demo gekommen bist, wenn du glaubst, da wären Rassisten oder Antisemiten unterwegs. Das ist direkt zum Schiessen. 😂🥳. Lass dich nicht veräppeln.
ger_test_2870	@PeterBe38098838 @reitschuster Die richtige Reaktion wäre, diese Spezialisten einfach ignorieren.   Mir sagt keiner was ich zu tun und zu lassen habe.  Wenn ich will, gehe ich auch ohne Maske im Supermarkt. Dieser Unsinn funktioniert nur, weil die Mehrheit diesen Unsinn mitmacht.
ger_test_2871	@Team_ReaIity @CScripturam @Karl_Lauterbach @maithi_nk Nur weil dir ihre Videos gewaltig gegen den Strich gehen, haben sie nichts mit Wissenschaft zu tun? Na? Merkste wat?
ger_test_2872	@L_Rebecca_ Bissl einseitige Sichtweise..  Israel hat genau so eine rassistische extremistische Regierung..  und diskriminiert Palästinenser!

ger_test_2890	@Markus__Lanz @Wissing Die FDP weiß genau was das Thema Ausgangssperren bringt, man überlässt ein bestimmtes Wählerklientel nicht alleine der AfD. Die Sendung war ein echtes Gefühlschaos. Zwei Politiker dessen  Aussagen größtenteils beleidigend für halbwegs Intelligente waren.

ger_test_3081	@MariaSchonherr @01Abubakre01 @ketoman25 @tagesschau Wohnraum ist knapp und teuer und das nutzt die Tagesschau zum relativieren von linksextremer Gewalt.

ger_test_3087	@yasminecmbarek Vielleicht ist genau dass das Problem, dass über die „neuen“ Bundesländer nur berichtete wird wenn es um Rechte Horrorszenarien geht.

ger_test_3153	@aljoli69 @laliatuk @vollekannette Weil die Impfungen tatsächlich für sehr viele Bürger erst am Ende des Sommers (hoffentlich) erfolgt sind!

ger_test_3815	#SarsCov2 mutiert - deshalb können wir nicht "mit dem Virus leben" wie #Streeck, BM #Spahn, MP #Laschet und #Wieler es wollen. Wenn wir es tun, mutiert das Virus #B171 #P1 #B1617.. , rekombiniert sich, wird übertragbarer und infiziert auch "#Immunisierte" https://t.co/0Qz2KqeJz5
ger_test_3816	@Alemanniel keine Maske, nicht testen und nicht impfen lassen  da hat die #Covidioten-Tussi halt Pech gehabt!  #Querdenker haben nichts in der Birne und können deshalb auch beruflich nix werden.  sieht man auch am #Ballweg ;-)  die #EvaRosen scheint auch nichts können.

ger_test_3834	@KathaSchulze Ich vermute, die Analyse ist zu einfach. Als junge Frau in einer Führungsposition stelle ich oft fest: Männer empfinden uns als Provokation. Sie fürchten Bedeutungsverlust. Wir schreddern ihr Weltbild. Wir beeinflussen ihre Töchter und stärken ihre Frauen. Eine Theorie
ger_test_3835	@wahrerDemokrat @KokospalmeBlog @PrimeiroLopez @KeilaniFatina Die Nazis wollten nicht retten, sondern als "Übermensch" die Welt unterwerfen.

ger_test_4059	@DonShlonzo @J_to_F @KathaZachi @Deprifrei @cdu_thueringen Das Problem ist, dass es auch innerhalb der Parteien Ränder gibt.

ger_test_4060	@reitschuster #GreatReset - Mehr muss man zu dem ganzen Zirkus hier in Deutschland nicht mehr sagen.

ger_test_4675	Im Übrigen finde ich nicht, dass hier die Bundes-@CDU hätte eingreifen müssen. Das hätte man in Thüringen tun müssen. Die Frage ist ja, ob die CDU im Osten radikale Wessis braucht, um Wahlen zu gewinnen. Das wäre bitter!
ger_test_4676	@rjs05h @happyl1ttlepleb @restmeinesleben @Wahlrecht_de Hat damit nichts zu tun. Demokratie ist das Volk und dazu gehören auch Kinder und Jugendliche.

ger_test_4791	@Sarah__Blacky Ich will erstmal klarstellen dass ich kein Querdenker bin und Maßnahmen gegen weitere Coronainfektionen grundsätzlich unterstütze. Aber die Ausgangssperre ist ein massiver Eingriff und wenn man dem gegenüberstellt dass es für Büros, Unternehmen und so quasi NIX gibt...
ger_test_4792	@janboehm Bedeutet wieder: es gibt keinen Antisemitismus unter muslimischen Migranten.  Was sind das dann für islamistisch bis türkisch-nationalistische ("pro-palästinensische") Aufmärsche auf den Straßen? Ist Juden töten zu wollen auf einmal nicht antisemitisch?
ger_test_4793	@jimmycd69 @Gewaltpeter @davidbest95 @greenpeace_de Es ist ermüdend wenn immer wieder "Gegenargumente" kommen die längst debunked sind und dann "Wissenschaftler sind gekauft" als Totschlagargument kommt. Es ändert wenig, dass man den letzteren selektiv einsetzt (zumal im EUParl die Grünen dann plötzlich doch impfskeptisch stimmen)
ger_test_4794	@FrederikPapier @watwillse @ZentralratJuden @ulfposh Jetzt füge ich nochmal mein Senf hinzu.  Ich vermute Mal, das dies nicht NUR für antisemitische Straftaten gilt.

Ihr könnt ihn aber trotzdem machen! (1/5) #8maifeiertag #tagderbefreiung #befreiunghh #nonazishh https://t.co/34oWtr4eWV
ger_test_5777	@Karl_Lauterbach Mit Verlaub, aber die Gesamtbilanz ist nicht mehr zu retten. Wir hatten alles in der Hand um über 80K Tote und unzählige Langzeitgeschädigte zu vermeiden und haben jetzt nichts besseres zu tun als SARS-CoV2 durch die die Ungeimpften und Kinder und Jugendlichen rauschen zu lassen.
ger_test_5778	@Karl_Lauterbach Eine Frage, warum werden Impfstoffe patentiert und verhindern armen Ländern den Zugang, was die ganze Situation und den Lauf  der Pandemie maßgeblich in die Länge zieht?
ger_test_5779	@robecker71 @DiggeTonne @MacalaniaMagic @tagesschau Die sind auch zum größten Teils Nazis. Der rechte Flügel war nur der extremste Haufen von 'nem ohnehin schon Rechtsextremen Haufen.
ger_test_5780	Ja, die AFD ist allgemein ein Haufen Müll, dreckiger Abschaum im moralischen Sinne. Hier jedoch hat Alice Weidel, hat die AFD recht! Der Lockdown schadet mehr als er nutzt. Wer nur #ARDZDFSiffpropaganda inhaliert, an Morbus Merkules leidet, vertauscht Angst mit Fakten. #Freiheit https://t.co/Kz2fdz9git
ger_test_5781	@eduardt_s @OmaOlivias @comm_cationista @RolliFraeulein Ist glaube eher so ein soziales Ausgrenzungsding. Billstedt=Assi Du hast natürlich Recht das da auch Rassismus mitschwingt. Aber es ist schon mehr das Drama der Großwohnsiedlung, ist auch nur ne Plattenbausiedlung.
ger_test_5782	@faznet Auffallend sachliche beschreibung, liebe linkspopulisten. Das passt ins Bild : gegen friedliche querdenker wird gehetzt auf Teufel komm raus und Antifa linksterroristengewalt wird als das nornalste von der Welt dargestellt. Widerlich framend. 🤮
ger_test_5783	@michaeljweider @DrStrompen @ZentralratJuden Was bist du für einer? Menschen importieren...Sagt mir alles. Und tschüß.
ger_test_5784	@ChristineFische Feige und unsolidarisch sind ja wohl nur diejenigen, die den Lockdown für Alle mittragen, weil sie hysterische Angst vor einem meist harmlosen Virus haben und zudem noch zu faul und zu geizig sind, sich konsequent selbst zu schützen!
ger_test_5785	@AuswaertigesAmt @HeikoMaas Politiker und Medien, stellt Euch endlich vor den Staat Israel! Ihr tut zu wenig! Stattdessen lasst Ihr kriegerische Palästinenser in unseren Straßen demonstrieren und jüdische Einrichtungen zerstören! Ich erwarte viel mehr von Euch allen! @die_regierung @vonderleyen @welt @WDR
ger_test_5786	@EschViola @_Der_Ketzer_ @FreiFrank3 @herr_sin @Karl_Lauterbach @Alice_Weidel Es hat die Änderungen am Infektionsschutzgesetz beschlossen. Also hat es etwas zu sagen.
ger_test_5787	@AfD Wir haben Pressefreiheit, ihr wollt gerne gleichschalten. Gerade weil euer geistiger Dünnpfiff als solcher dargestellt wird ist der Beweis. Genau wie die ganzen rechten "Zeitungen" die Freiheit haben eure Lügen und Angstmachereien zu verbreiten. Ihr seid schon so arme Opfer
ger_test_5788	@de_rt_com @Dummokratie Komisch wo sich doch sogar ein Hersteller dafür ausgesprochen hat Merkel und ihr wahres Gesicht Menschenleben sind ihr völlig Wurst mittlerweile verachte ich diese Frau nicht mehr ich hasse sie
ger_test_5789	Das die Polizei auf Demos Querdenker bei Verstößen festnimmt ist nicht das Problem sondern das bei augenscheinlich bei diversen anderen Gruppen nicht annähernd so konsequent durchgegriffen wird

ger_test_5794	@wasner_huber @pnp Wieso fürchte? Jede Stimme für die AfD ist richtig und wichtig. 😉😀
ger_test_5795	@SabineBr3 @SabineBr3 :  Sie ist aber immerhin gut in Orthographie und Zeichensetzung. Da könnten Sie, Sabine, sicherlich noch viel von ihr lernen… PS: kritisieren und runtermachen ist einfach, besser machen schon deutlich schwieriger!
ger_test_5796	@Michael43379562 Zwei mal nein, ich bin nur sehr besorgt. Ich informiere mich gerne auch über Twitter, hier sind beide Fraktionen Querdenker und Faktenverweigerer vertreten. Hier sollte man sich an Gesetze halten...beleidigen bedrohen usw geht nicht...

ger_test_5805	@Karl_Lauterbach Bro, corona gut und schön aber lass den Grill in Ruhe. Hier hört’s halt jetzt komplett auf.
ger_test_5806	@kostjaullmann Danke dir. Mir hat es tatsächlich weg getan, dich in der Liste zu sehen. Viele Leute, auch ich, sind nicht begeistert von den Maßnahmen, fragen uns, ob sie in die richtige Richtung gehen. Aber wenn man die Folgen von überfüllten Notaufnahmen sieht und darauf hoffen kann, ⬇️
ger_test_5807	@Silke74918142 Was mich ankotzt: Da feiern die Querdenker illigale Partys, stecken Sich und ihre Kinder an und bekommen als Genesene als erste ihre Freiheit zurück, während die Alten auf der Intensiv ersticken.
ger_test_5808	@PeterBe38098838 @reitschuster https://t.co/CRpY3585lW  Da hat doch sogar der Tagesspiegel Probleme von dem ehrenwerten Minister Auskuenfte zu bekommen. Thema zu heikel?
ger_test_5809	Die #Bundesregierung hat ihre Wachstumsprognose für die dt. Wirtschaft auf 3,5% angehoben. Hier dürfte der Wunsch Vater des Gedankens gewesen sein. Das #HRI ist infolge der noch nicht sichtbaren langfristigen Folgen der #Pandemie skeptischer. #handelblatt https://t.co/Vvu3nhoQCU
ger_test_5810	@AfDimBundestag @BrischleU Das Ganze zeigt, auf welchem Niveau wir nach 16 Jahren Merkel gelandet sind. Dass eine ungezogene, ungebildete und als freche Göre rüberkommende Person allen Ernstes als mögliche Bundeskanzlerin gehandelt wird, kommt einem vor wie ein böser Traum! #Aufstehen @CDU
ger_test_5811	@jensspahn Ich warte als Prio 3 - Gruppe seit Wochen auch einen Impf-Termin und bekomme keinen. Um mich rum, Jugendliche, junge gesunde Menschen, die mit einem Zettel „ich bringe Opa Einkäufe“ sofort geimpft werden. Ich kotze ab…
ger_test_5812	@polenz_r @Puettmann_Bonn Das zeigt aber trotzdem was für ein Haufen die CDU ist und war. Schaut man auf die Lebensläufe der AfD sieht man was für Faschofans in eurem Haufen waren.
ger_test_5813	@Die_Gruenen @ABaerbock Wenigstens etwas war mindestens 1,5 Grad zu heiss: die Luftblasen😂  Einen Baerbock schiessen: „Ich zerbrech mir nicht den Kopf mit welchen Farbkonzelamationen man wie regieren könnte“
ger_test_5814	@CisF61 @sunstar1606 @reitschuster @CisF61 das ist zu intellektuell für ihn. Du musst eher sowas schwurbeln, das versteht er: «Wer Technolien prodiziert mit neuerbaren Energierern zum Paukreis Kapaufpreis, provoziert Technogie jedensfalls und enpzemblarisch attrative Enegien!

ger_test_5815	@Hoaxmistress @MattGrandis Ich liebe Zynismus. Ich finde, er ist eine tolle Form, um auf Missstände hinzuweisen. Aber die Deppen unter dem Hashtag #allesdichtmachen decken keine Missstände auf, sie sähen nur Zweifel. Die Pandemiepolitik ist unter aller Sau! Weil sie nicht weit genug geht!
ger_test_5816	@MagKeinenKaba #Kadavergehorsam  schleppen die Deutschen seit Jahrtausenden mit sich herum. Das behindert auch den einzelnen Polizisten in der Wahrnehmung von Gut und Schlecht. Wer scheißt denen regelmäßig ins Gehirn?...denn mit Normalität hat das nichts mehr zu tun.
ger_test_5817	Seid ihr Linken/Rotpunktfaschisten/Antifanten hirntote Amöben? Wer jetzt noch nicht erkennt dass es nicht um ein Virus sondern nur um die Abschaffung aller Grund- und Freiheitsrechte geht, kann sich ja selbst daheim einsperren. #HaltDieFresseBild #Infektionsschutzgesetz

ger_test_5821	@MWuliger @anetta2552 Liebe @anetta2552 , was Sie so retweeten. Allesdichtmachen ist ein so willkommenes wie unangemessenes Ziel für diese Rhetorik. Wie wär's gewesen, statt Ausgangssperre die Testpflicht für Unternehmen zu fordern. Wir müssen nicht alle zu nützlichen Idioten der Bundespolitik werden.
ger_test_5822	@TheRealMibra @EskenSaskia Kritisch. Die deutsche Sprache braucht an dieser Stelle nicht verkompliziert zu werden. Da halte ich es mit Macron und Merz
ger_test_5823	wieso het mir keine gseit dass es eh film git wo nazis ufem mond lebe und d erde überfalle
ger_test_5824	@Politleben @Th_Seitz_AfD @politwelt Sehr gut. Wer mit derartigen Begriffen wie Seitz um sich wirft, ist nichts weiter als asozialer Abschaum und stellt den Bodensatz der Gesellschaft dar.
ger_test_5825	Demokratie und Sicherheit ??? Beides hat Merkel eindrucksvoll geradezu ausgeschaltet ...  Euch ist doch das Volk egal nur weil Wahlen anstehen wird wieder ordentlich der sprichwörtliche Honig ums Maul geschmiert, Ihr seid keine Volkspartei dafür aber die AfD umso mehr https://t.co/QkIEEzsYub

ger_test_5827	@GruberRajesh @Ichbins2009 @DrStrompen @ZentralratJuden Einzigartig? Hast du gepennt das letzte Jahr bezüglich Querdenker und Co.? Die sind nur so clever es nicht als Sprechchor zu machen. Ist aber beides inakzeptabel. Nur wird gegen die Form der "Querdenker" kaum juristisch vorgegangen während das hier wohl der Fall sein wird.
ger_test_5828	@Jr6en1 @Karl_Lauterbach Ihr immer mit eurem Scheinwissen aus der Verschwörungsszene. Nichts, aber auch gar nichts bekommt ihr mit Verstand sortiert. Aber das Fakewissen zieht ihr wie Morgellons aus dem Hinterkopf.
ger_test_5829	@rbrinkhaus Unfassbar wieviel scheisse im Hirn stecken kann. Sie haben den Bezug zur Realität verloren.und Sie sollen ein Politiker sein??? Ist das was Deutschland repräsentiert. Lächerlich. Ihnen geht es nur um verunglimpfung der Afd. Aber sonst keine nützlichen argumente. Eckelhaft
ger_test_5830	@ThomasKunzfeld @HohlerAli @moerv_vom_doerf @JohannesNormann @SerapGueler Dabei ist Einwanderungsbeschränkung eigentlich ein klassisch linkes Ding. Die liberalen und Anarchisten, die sich gerne mit »links« schmücken, liebe dahingehend Einwanderung.
ger_test_5831	@watwillse @ZentralratJuden @ulfposh Das ist genau so falsch. Die Strukturen haben sich nicht massiv geändert. Es wird seit Jahren toleriert und es gibt im heutigen Bundestag immer noch Parteien die dulden das ihre Mitglieder den holocaust leugnen. Oder sind das alles gescheiterte Migranten?
ger_test_5832	@Bibaboffel @mots751 @SteffenSchlager @Karl_Lauterbach Für Schwurbler scheint der Horizont begrenzt zu sein, sonst wüssten Sie, dass es durchaus auch Fachtexte im Internet gibt, wo man sich informieren kann. Ja, es gibt noch eine Welt außerhalb von "bild".
ger_test_5833	Ich lach mich scheckig. Prof. Ulrichs disst nebenbei die AfD. Sie hätren wohl ein Problem mit Fakten und Zahlen. Einfach genial! #Lanz
ger_test_5834	@ABaerbock @Koelner_Peter Die Äußerung von Palmer war sarkastisch gemeint. Um Sarkasmus oder Humor zu begreifen, muss man ein Minimum an Verstand oder Intelligen besitzen. Das ist leider nicht jeder Person gegeben, die sich dazu äußert....
ger_test_5835	@learnerfdg @SteffenSchlager @Karl_Lauterbach Warum Langzeitstudien. Entweder es gibt Schäden im unmittelbaren Zeitraum der Impfung oder keine, denn der Körper baut den Impfstoff wieder ab. Kann man alles nachlesen. Dieses Argument zieht nicht mehr.
ger_test_5836	@gsmich01 @shoutingcassy @dutschman @ABaerbock Planwirtschaft kann niemals die Lösung sein, denn wir wissen aus der Geschichte, dass PW immer versagt hat, um mit den gegebenen Ressourcen das Maximum an Ouput/Resultat zu bekommen. Was nat auch gut für die Umwelt ist.  Es wird im Kapitalismus niemand gezwungen etwas zu kaufen.
ger_test_5837	Ich bin gespannt 😊. Ich drücke #Baerbock die Daumen 😊
ger_test_5838	@c_lindner @ABaerbock Wird sie tun. Also die Hilfe der Linkspartei beanspruchen. Dann "Gute Nacht" D. R2G ist der Untergang der volkswirtschaftlichen Vernunft. Somit im Herbst CDU/CSU + FDP wählen.
ger_test_5839	@hauidoinit Dann haben deine paar Kiddies beim G20 Gipfel in Hamburg alles kurz und klein geschlagen und sich Straßenschlachten mit der Polizei geliefert. Wie kann man so dumm sein und  als Politiker so einen Schwachsinn schreiben. #antifa ist linker Faschismus.
