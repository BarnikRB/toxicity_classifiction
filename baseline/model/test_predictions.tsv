2	eng_test_2	Y'all pull your head out of your ass. Transgender women are not going to hurt you or your children. It's just yur ignorance about other people that puts fear into yur thick skulls. Yur just pissed off cuz you lost the LBGT fight in the supreme court. It's the transgender girls that need protection from you.	1
3	eng_test_3	No, greed is to live in a home built from wood, and then advocate depriving others of a home built of wood, because the vulgar hypocrite thinks all logging is evil, except when it came to building a home for them.	1
4	eng_test_4	If someone tells you up front that they are an entertainer or an advocate you know that they are trying to persuade you to point of view. That's fine because you can accept it or not. On the other had we have comedians criticizing politicians and then saying "Just Funning". At least the KKK doe's not say they are 'Fair & Balanced'.	0

6	eng_test_6	He does??  The smiley faces emoticon is typically used for three reasons... 1). Something is genuinely funny; 2). To convey "your remark is ridiculous.  I think you're an idiot," and 3). A not-so-subtle form of bullying.  The first reason is pretty much rarely used on this site.	1
7	eng_test_7	Excellent dose of reality revealing the stupidity of every Republican policy.  Time for Revolution NOW!	1
8	eng_test_8	"For now, the House GOP's health care plan would provide each state a fixed sum for each beneficiary – no matter how much or little of the costs that funding covered."  This proposal hurts high-cost states like Alaska the most, as states with low health care costs would get the same amount per person as those in high cost states.  The former would get more funding than they need, and the latter would get less.  Sad!	0
9	eng_test_9	Good to know that the Alaska Republican Party officially condones racism, anti- Muslim and anti-Mexican statements, and misogynistic statements- including lots of disgusting comments about women before the so -called "locker room tapes" became public.   Good luck with that.	1

11	eng_test_11	Looking at the Facebook posts, it appears this young man thought he was Mario Andretti.  Too bad he lost his life he was a pretty popular guy and by all appearances on Facebook a pretty decent kid.	0
12	eng_test_12	My facts came from the same place you got your 1000 vote pickup in 2014.  Back that up with actual facts, I dare ya.  Also if "TEA is ...not a party and has no representation" then anyone claimng they picked up 1000 seats in the 2014 election must have their head up their rump.  Wouldn't you agree?	0

25	eng_test_25	You are a f.cking idiot. The Whole Country knows that the BC Carbon tax was created in BC when Campbell removed the bank capital tax have you been in a coma?	1
26	eng_test_26	Living next door and having access to 50% of the largest auto market in the world sounds pretty good to me.   Now Canada should reciprocate and give  the US access to 50% of Canada's dairy and chicken market.  Do I hear cries of "Oh, No...."	0
27	eng_test_27	That sounds like a great way to drum up some extra revenue. The key will setting the fines just right. They need to be high enough to make it the endeavor profitable, yet low enough so as to not drastically decrease the number of people getting caught running red lights.	0

32	eng_test_32	For Russians posting here: it is "quotation," not quote. The latter (i.e. to quote) is a verb.. To cite something someone has said is properly referred to as a quotation (a noun). No charge for the English lesson. That said who cares what the KGB man in the Kremlin has to say about anything? He's a liar.	0

35	eng_test_35	Commentaire  You and Catou really should learn how to use Globe and Mail's stock page.   BNS traded at $2.75 (split adjusted - just sayin') in 1982, 1984 & 1990.   I doubt SFI is lying.  After conversing with him for at least 5 years, I have learned his posts are credible.  Like it or not.	0
36	eng_test_36	You are a bloody idiot. Water does NOT create mercury into water, however the tailing ponds and the OIL/ BITUMEN itself KILLS INSTANTLY - wildlife, people (hundreds died living near the oil sands loaded with chemical in the water producing deformed fish/food) and produces birth defects and CANCER.	1
37	eng_test_37	What no one can answer is what is the plan to dispose of these bio-hazards in 6-7 years when their batteries are dead, the paint is faded, and the interior smells?  Do we really want thousand of these cars abandoned all over our islands?  Who is going to pay to dispose of the dead batteries?  Ah, the unintended consequences!	0
38	eng_test_38	McDow, we can agree to disagree but independents and republicans far out number democrats and progressives in Alaska, and it is this factor Walker was elected. Just saying.... So which of the big three does Walker want to buy out with your dividend?	0
39	eng_test_39	Steve...I think it's the same "scapegoat" phenomena, that Trump played to with such vigor....presenting  the Trumpies with someone to hate....ie "bad hombres" uppity women like Hillary,   et al.....to the tune of "lock her up" build a wall....et al.....what totally mistifies me is how institutional hierarchy was so dumb as to support this man?

45	eng_test_45	Antarctic sea ice is also at an all-time low for this day of the year, same with the Arctic. That means, of course, that global sea ice extent is at an all-time low for this day of the year. What’s surprising is just how low it is.

49	eng_test_49	OK What is it about? Nobody can answer. Kapernick wears kill cop socks. Is that the protest? Kill cops? Plus it all started when Obama was president so now it's about Trump? I never heard Brandon Marshall explain why he was kneeling. These guys look stupid in that they're now standing like everybody has forever and somehow that's a gesture of unity? None of it ever made sense.	1

52	eng_test_52	So, by your "logic," any person of color who doesn't publically admonish gang members and refuse to live by the Snitches Get Stitches code, they are all "thug criminals."  Same, same, right?  Is that your argument?	1
53	eng_test_53	Actually, you would be completely wrong, Mister woman-hating, right wing, Caucasian male.  Just because most right wing Caucasian males have Mommy Issues and hate powerful, take-no-guff women does NOT mean normal Americans do not want to hear Hillary's 'take.' What NO normal, Trump-opposing American cares about ... drum roll for the Trumpty Dumpties ... is the pathetic sexist opinions of another woman-hating, right wing, Caucasian male.  Go tell your Mommy your pasty boy tales and whines, Wegmann.	1

59	eng_test_59	Do we have to keep filling up within 100 miles of the US/Canada border so we are like countries where you can't go two feet without stepping on someone ?  Canada for all intents and purposes have enough people and continued computerization and robotization won't make matters better.  Trudeau gets an "F" for increased debt and carbon taxes, addicting our young kids with pot, giving our money away to the UN for tinpot dictators to buy villas, and for going on vacation all the time and not spending enough time creating real jobs, not government debt-fuelled ones which only steal from the future generations.	0

61	eng_test_61	When is the next federal election?  I have gotten to the point where just looking at this silly little boy's face or hearing his  lisping sanctimonious voice makes me furious.	0
62	eng_test_62	I gave you a like, Philly--there's nothing funny about what you say, I believe it's true.  That's what "civil" means.    Interesting, but, in order to have my own comment reach this electronic page,  when I read someone else's well-stated, literate comment which does not insult anyone and contains no derogatory words--four-letter or longer--I often STILL have to remind myself it is "civil" and say so.    Howcum?  Because the comment can be ignorant.  It can be misguided.  It can be   stupid or fatuous, too.  BUT it is "civil."  So the "ratings" mean "be polite."  That's big in Canada; what we're known for.	0
63	eng_test_63	Mauicitizen  No one is forced to do anything in regard to water fluoridation.  If you knew that your tap water was contaminated with significant amounts of cyanide, would you still drink it simply because it flowed from your faucet, or would you obtain your water from another source?  Inconvenience, regardless the degree, does not constitute force.  Steven D. Slott, DDS	0

69	eng_test_69	No, no, no!    Haven't you been keeping up?  Trump is now confirming that man-made climate change is a fact.  It's being caused by radical Islamic terrorists.	1
70	eng_test_70	I think your last statement is the answer to its own question. Canada has a trade imbalance with China (as does virtually every major economy) and free trade can help reduce or eliminate that. China has to open its economy to outside companies and investors. To right the imbalance, trade has to flow both ways.	0
71	eng_test_71	I was in Kodiak when they decided to institute a parking 'tax' at the airport.  It now costs more to collect this than is put in.  Most people drop off the travellers at the airport now so collecting a few dollars Dailey then paying someone to collect it is a lose lose situation.  This is what is happening now with weed, it costs more to administer it than is collected in taxes.	0
72	eng_test_72	Trump should be impeached immediately by the Congress of the United States to demonstrate that the American Constitution, for which men and women have fought and died, can withstand a heinous moron from the world of reality television. How did this creature ever finagle his way into the presidency?  And this is happening in several countries - populism. BS!!!	1
73	eng_test_73	Ms. Rodell should insist that any money taken from dividends be loans from the people that will be paid back by the state when the state digs itself out of the fiscal ditch we find ourselves in.	0
74	eng_test_74	They're doing their darnedest to declare any amount of booze harmful, despite decades of of evidence showing that moderate drinking is associated with lower mortality from all causes. And I'm sure they'll eventually succeed. It might even be true -- who knows.  Meanwhile, there are those of us who recognize that — when it comes to your own body — "good" is what you make it. There are some folks out there willing to sacrifice any corporeal pleasures for a small gain in mental acuity or longevity, and then there are others prepared to give up a certain amount of those for the enjoyment of a drink every now and then.  Prescribing one preference function for the entire population (as tempting as this is for control freaks) misses the point. It's about choice.	0
75	eng_test_75	I was in Golden a month ago. Nobody likes to lose their view but it is becoming an urban environment. That isn't going to change.   It is generally true that if you live in an urban environment you usually don't have a view, unless you can pay for it. NYC, LA, Boston, Miami, ect. It comes with dense urbanization.   When cities minimize vertical space it incentives developers to build horizontally to fill out the maximum dwelling units that zoning will allow. We end up with these cereal box looking buildings that push the setbacks on all sides of the lot. The result is minimal open space on the parcel.    Taller buildings with smaller footprints leave more lot room for amenities and open space at the base. That is just how urbanization works. Encouraging smaller footprints, and taller builds at least leaves space on the lot for some green for residents. Build them now and lock in the open space or lose that potential some point in the future.	0
76	eng_test_76	Thank you Ms. Clarkson for this thoughtful column. As the child of immigrants from Scotland after the war we had the advantage of the language and my father had training in the Royal Navy as an engineer. He upgraded at our cities technical college in the evenings (during the day his job was tearing up trolley car tracks for the railway). Like many if not most Canadians, I have sympathy for the plight of the indigenous people. Driving through the core of our city I sometimes see toddlers of aboriginal descent out on the sidewalks by themselves and not properly clothed for our climate. I've often thought to myself, what chance do they have? They haven't chosen to live in these circumstances. Yet when I see reports of life on isolated reserves with suicide and substance dependence issues I wonder if this is the way our country should be continuing. I also think that there are some in the indigenous community who have a stake in the continuity of this system. Maybe it's time for change.	0
77	eng_test_77	It will be drained once we get rid of Trump. He's a total incompetent. Trump will be forced to resign once he's exposed of all his illegal dealings with Russia. The guy is a liar. Just like Hillary. Pence will be the next president.	1

81	eng_test_81	Congratulations on being the dump for America's trash. US Border Patrol is once again laughing at the baffled Canadians	1
82	eng_test_82	The story is a bit unclear in where they work.  Are they in uniform while playing?  Are they on company property?  That bit of info might help discern if the boss is justified.  The next legal question is who owns the lunch hour?  If the employee is unpaid during lunch, how does the boss have control (uniform and property issues aside)?	0
83	eng_test_83	You are preaching to the converted, with me. Nothing worse than a cold bottom, and winter becomes a delightful season if all your bits stay warm. I can exercise or walk to work until minus 25 if I have layers. Probably down to minus 35, but really, what's the point. Discovered that I can tuck my dresses into snow pants, with long johns pulled over my nylons, and give myself a quick touch up once I reach the office. Way more fun walking than spending 10 minutes s scraping a car, while wearing inadequate clothes at either end of the commute. In the end, I notice the cold less while walking than while waiting for a car to warm up.	0
84	eng_test_84	"Obviously over the hill?" Not so sure. But I confess I have not seen much of Kings games nor Iggy this year. Kopitar is on a minor streak, over the past 3 games anyway.   My Canucks would dearly love to be in the Kings position! I am with Goat. The problem seems to be more at the goalie position. Maybe they should have traded with the Canucks for Miller.	0

94	eng_test_94	First off, I am happy I was not hallucinating when I was telling people, after the FTA came down with it's dictum, that rail was no longer a issue that would decide the Mayoral race. So for that, thank you Dr. Milner.   And with that, I would just like to add to Dr. Milner's points about this race being more about the fundamentals. Basically, outside of being a better master of disaster, which really comes down to judging management styles, this race will become, if it already has, about even more basic bread-and-butter issues like who has a better plan for repaving the roads or more efficient garbage services, or how property taxes will be calculated once elected. You know, issues that make many yawn.   The only issue that I could see that may inspire some to interest is that of economic development in the C&C. Fasi and Harris used that angle at times to spur interest in the voters, but both these candidates are leaving that on the table.	0

100	eng_test_100	No.  Trump adopted the phrase 'America First' because it was an old racist Nazi buzzword from years ago. It was a dog-whistle siren call to his white supremacist brethren. Then Bannon spewed out some word salad for Trump to further butcher in an attempt to deny it. They came up with the empty 'isolationism' that Trump immediately denied when he met with Merkel. Trump never had any foreign policy, other than looking to skim money wherever he could. He's a petty con man, not an actual reasoned or sane human being, he's a fraud. He's imbalanced, unfit for office. Now we have a weak and insecure, belligerent child who imagines himself a fascist saviour. He's no more than an egotistical juvenile buffoon. We need to remove him from the office, get him out of office now.  Trump is a white supremacist, Nazi sympathizer who should be removed from office.	1

106	eng_test_106	You keep trying to belittle the fact that he had a nervous breakdown. You are vastly ignorant by calling it "was sad".  Ignorance never stopped you, eh? Somehow you equate being able to pool scant resources with long-term employability.  When was the last time you went looking for a job?   Then you move on "hundreds of junkies", claiming they chose addiction. Some, sure. But it looks like you missed the Pulitzer Prize winning series in The Seattle Times about how opioid prescribing excess and sudden withholding is driving agonized patients to alternate drugs. Could be you someday, be careful. Yes, institutionalization is appropriate.  Odom has a supervised situation with standards now. You reveal your "desire to drive them...out of state".  Feel the same about developmentally delayed adults? Violent head-injury victims too? PTSD mumblers? Your fears and subsequent hatred of mental illnesses that you still don't comprehend shows your vile attitude. Your choice. Or volunteer and learn.	1

113	eng_test_113	I agree that Kuhl's pitch was intentional. That's what happens when you hit a team's best player... accidental or not. Especially the day after FOUR Pirates got hit. Not saying the Rockies did it intentionally, but at some point a team has to protect their players and establish a consequence for not "mastering command" yet. And again... 5 Pirates were hit and didn't charge the mound. One Rockie got brushed back and did. Perspective.	0

115	eng_test_115	Most employers would love to quadruple what they pay in pension costs, give their employees an additional 10 weeks of vacation, give them 7 days per year to write reports, force their employees to work an entire 4 hours per day on the days that they are not on vacation or using up their 120 sick days.

119	eng_test_119	Wow. Trudeau suggests that he will finally abolish the Indian Act - something that conservative Rebel Media personality Ezra Levant has been pushing for years.  But let's wait and see if it's real change or just new lipstick on the same old pig.	0
120	eng_test_120	I suggest to think over one simple question: if we leave North Korea alone, what will happen? Do you really think North Korea will strike at its Korean neighbour on the South? or send its puny "ICBM"s  in the direction of the US?  You may be surprised by the actual answer but it is as simple as that: nothing will happen! Surely, we will continue feel a pity to the enslaved population of North Korea, but it is all we can (and should) be doing. We do not need any drum beat - just very pointy sanctions. We do not need to deploy thousands and thousands of new troops along with all that weaponry on the Korean peninsula - we already have enough to thwart their questionable military supremacy over South Korea.

Mandela promise free houses pre-1994. The need may have been there but it was an irresponsible and unrealistic promise to make because which society anywhere at any time has been free of need, and expects government to provide everything? It became policy and the consequences are the Grootboom and Marikana decisions. At the moment beneficiaries receive a serviced dwelling and plot. BNG and self-build options are almost never heard of. Why? Rentals were tried at N2 Gateway Project but after it opened tenants refused to pay, I think R600pm-plus. I don't know what happened later.

The B.C. NDP governed for a decade during a time when nearly every other Province was balancing their budgets but they just produced one deficit after another.  None of our parties have particularly "good" fiscal records, but the NDP certainly has NOT been the "best", especially if you look at any NDP other than the Saskatchewan NDP.  Even if you were to re-run the same calculation from the article you had linked, including the recent NDP deficits in Nova Scotia, Manitoba and Alberta, their record looks far worse then it did 6 years ago.	0

207	eng_test_207	If you are expecting the DFI to limit its regulatory oversight to bitcoin payment processors, I'm afraid you may be misreading the situation. When Mt. Gox failed three years ago, the DFI issued the following warning:   "DFI licenses money transmitters in Hawaii and has not licensed any crypto-currency companies to do bitcoin exchanges, wallets or “mining” activity. If companies are offering to transmit bitcoins, they are doing so in violation of Hawaii’s money transmitter laws." (Source: http://cca.hawaii.gov/dfi/bitcoin-warning/)  To include mining activity and wallets (which could even include desktop software on a home computer) represents an expansive view of what constitutes money transmission. The law is written in such a way that it broadly defines money transmitters, with a few narrow exclusions, giving the department a lot of latitude to justify application of that law to nearly every aspect of crypto-currency use.	0
208	eng_test_208	Some of the best and brightest docs do a lot of research, for example clinical trials required for the development of medicines and devices. A member of the public who simply thinks "docs who earn more money are worse docs" might avoid those experts, instead of seeking them out.  As it happens, those docs are in very high demand, generally have long waiting lists, and will be happy not to see patients who see a negative correlation between income and quality.  Conversely, there are great docs who have no outside income, so a patient who thought "more income is better" might make the mistake of avoiding an excellent doc.  Trying to judge docs on the basis of their gross revenue from pharma and device work is about as dumb as trying to judge them on the basis of scores from anonymous social media like RateMDs, Yelp, etc.	0

320	eng_test_320	As a card carrying libertarian, I find this initiative appalling. Any regressive democrat with a preschool level understanding of economics would know that artificially limiting growth in the housing market will only drive housing costs higher, further driving out the poor by making it more unaffordable to live in Colorado. It's called supply and demand. If the supply of a highly demanded product goes down, the cost for that product goes up, especially if that demand is artificially limited.  All the policies that have been passed in the last 20 years by so-called progressives have created the perfect storm in the Colorado housing crisis we have today: increased property taxes, inordinately high and unnecessary construction standards which drive up insurance costs for developers, and now artificially capping growth. If anything, this initiative is an attack on the poor. Funny how democrats attempts to help are actually making the housing situation worse for those on the bottom.	0

Fifty years ago my mother's brand new trailer house that we were not living it yet but had put all of our belongings in, caught fire within a few hours of the gas company hooking up the gas.  It exploded into flames and was totally consumed within a mater of seconds. The very thick and toxic smoke was so bad you couldn't see the trailer and the smell of buring insulation, carpet, plastic, tile, and plastic pipes made people close by vomit and burned our eyes. The intense heat caused all the lighting to melt, even the appliances melted.  Legally, the landlords ARE responsible for installing smoke alarms at the time of lease and if it's a month to month rental, then landlords are responsible.	0

But what I remembered most and never forgot, was him telling me about what happened to the Aleut people. He use to tell us that they were like us but they had been sent away to "camps" like what they had done to the Japanese people he had gone to high school with, who went to camps, loosing their homes and the carrot and lettuce fields they had owned.  I think he told us this because he wanted us to know and be aware it could happen to us too. I think he told us because he wanted us to remember because few people outside the Aleuts and Army knew about what had been done to them.  He told us about the Navajo code talkers before knowledge of them was public.	0

For guys that are already working a 56 hour week if you tack another 24 hour shift onto that.....they can't expect to work that for nothing.   AFD is understaffed, just like most of our city services. However better management of the leave, specifically a renegotiation to the leave policy in the union contract to limit how many of each position in the department can request projected leave at once, seems to be a reasonable solution. Projected time off should not generate overtime, and both sides of union negotiations should be on board with that.

368	eng_test_368	I foresee a lot of fake rental agreements signed between friends, with no follow up by city authorities to verify that a "renter" is actually living in the home, and no collaboration with federal tax authorities to verify that rent is actually being paid.  Someone could take out a mortgage and report rental income that is not actually being paid equal to the mortgage interest; the effect would be zero profit and thus no income tax, and no vacancy tax on what is actually a vacant property. But with the administrative costs paid for by honest people who do pay taxes.  A bonus from this predictable scheme is that people trying to prove residency in Canada for purpose of obtaining citizenship will now have a large pool of owners of vacant homes wanting to enter into fake rental agreements that benefits both parties. I predict immigration lawyers building a business around this opportunity.	0

376	eng_test_376	Nope....they're FCS.  Big Sky Conference football teams participate in the FCS playoffs, not the FBS bowls.  FBS and FCS schools are all NCAA Division I for the other sports (the Big Sky basketball tournament champion does, for instance, go to the NCAA Division I Tournament...usually as a #13-#16 seed).  In football, Eastern Washington, North Dakota, Cal Poly, and Weber State represented the Big Sky in the 2016 FCS Playoffs, with Eastern Washington losing to Youngstown State in the semifinals.  Scholarships numbers are the difference. NCAA FBS- 85 max. NCAA FCS- 65 max. NCAA Division II- Equivalent of up to 36 (can be partials between more than one athlete, for total up to 36).

387	eng_test_387	You have hit on a characteristic that is common with narcissists and it is related to my comment regarding an authentic self; they have no originality.  They mimic, mirror, and emulate others, adopting beliefs, activities and values of those they target, and they are dumbfoundingly skilled at it.  Their acting abilities are beyond what most people can understand, possibly because in the moment they believe themselves. One victim stated that they fake emotions better than ordinary people feel the real thing. It is regularly seen in abused spouses who have difficulty leaving their abuser.   The abuser turns on the charm, promises, goes on best behavior, woos, "love bombs," and ordinary people cannot believe that anyone who didn't really feel that way could possibly exert so much effort to lie.  Trump's voters are going to have difficulty believing they have been conned as much as they have, but they will.  Disillusionment is the only possible outcome to this disaster.	0

Yes, she is here unlawfully (and no, it is not illegally, the difference due to that violation being civil in nature, not criminal, but we won't let facts and things like that get in the way of the blood lust here). Yes, she committed a crime (related to identity theft, which for what it's worth, wasn't a crime until 1998).  One term that hasn't been used in a while, or, allowed, is that big heavy thing that holds a ship in place, rhymes with rancor, plus baby. Those children are US citizens. In so many other aspects of family law and elsewhere, the overriding trump card of justifying whatever is "the best interest of the child." The one major exception to this precept is immigration law. In this area of the law, the best interest of a child apparently carries zero weight.	0

408	eng_test_408	You're right: The Republicans -- especially McConnell and Ryan -- regard Trump as a "useful idiot" who will sign whatever they put on his desk. Trump is proving that their confidence is well placed as he pushes a healthcare bill that breaks every commitment he made about healthcare during the campaign and the transition. However, neither McConnell nor Ryan makes much effort to disguise their contempt for Trump, even as they (Ryan especially) fawn over him to get the healthcare farce passed. It is not hard to see that at some point, Trump will no longer be useful to them; he'll merely be an idiot. They'll turn on him in a New York minute and gleefully embrace President Pence. Trump's incompetence, corruption and lunacy are not sustainable. I think American politics have already rendered Trump no longer useful to Putin; to him, Trump is no loner useful; he's merely an idiot -- except to the extent that Trump's presidency is destabilizing both domestically and on the world's stage.	1

Why did these journalists not take into consideration any of the well run MICs in Canada?   My math directly from the article (includes only the MICs):  Losses due to Bad Management: $33.5 Million (Trimor, Infuse, Atlantic Tides, Optam, Prime West) Losses due to Fraud/Ponzi: $150 Million (Base Finance) Total Amount Invested According to Article:  $25 Billion  Even if you include the non MICs - Titan ($30 Million in syndicated mortgages) and Omni Arch ($100 Million US  Mortgages) it still only equate to 1.2% of the total industry.

All sign anti-disclosure documents so you won’t be hearing from any of them too soon. Ex- cult members and children who left after they realized their guru was a fraud may be the source to get some truth.  Butler through his network of devoted brainwashed followers have manipulated social media to bolster support for Gabbard. Brainwashed Tulsi is not ignorant of her actions, she hides behind her mask of deceit well, but one day the veil of her hypocrisy will be removed, but not until she chooses to divorce herself from the meddling claws of her guru who directs her every move both political and personal.	1
426	eng_test_426	“The Republicans engaged in historic obstructionism that made it possible for this confirmation process to be conducted,” said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. “We now have a radical right-wing justice on the Supreme Court.   Gorsuch is expected to join a conservative-leaning voting bloc of justices, making five on the nine-member court.  The above quotes are amazing in that the same old misinformation continues to be pushed. Judge Gorsuch isn't a "radical right-wing justice" by anyone's measure except someone who has a radical left-wing view. He has shown in the past to be very much like the justice he is replacing. And the "conservative-leaning voting bloc of justices" have "allowed" a fair number of liberal rulings, so it isn't that this changes the "tilt" of the court. The next appointment, however, could bring a dramatic shift.

430	eng_test_430	Measurement in the health care system is a double edged sword. On one side the information that results can help make better decisions. However, healthcare is laden with subjective human experience and intangibles which massively impact the data in unpredictable ways and can severely damage its value. Secondly, the collection of data is a labour intensive process, one which I suspect accounts for a significant portion of the 28.3% of the hospital budget. More data is not the answer, carefully measuring the correct information in a controlled environment is.  If I was setting up a measurement system, I would restrict most data measurement to specific study hospitals that were designed to be research intensive. The vast majority of hospitals do have neither the personnel or resources to do that now, meaning most of the data collected from them is often meaningless.	0

You seem to hold Harbaugh in high esteem. JH has displayed many faults, evident to any who choose to dig below the headlines.  And stating that WT "cares not a whit of what those outside his orbit think of him", actually presumes that he does care what those within his orbit think of him.  Obviously those within his orbit include opposing coaches. and you're right, they don't give this a second thought.  They understand why he had Alie throw the late pass, and don't whine about it.  That's crybaby stuff and beneath them.  WT has spoken quite well to a positive code of ethics from dismissing  Darren Carrington as well as a coach that set a poor example, to creating a positive environment with small group sensitivity awareness sessions for his athletes.  I find much positive evidence in his character and support him.    I'm out.	0

508	eng_test_508	Censorship is used to silence dissenting views.  All comments are closed, which means ADN is not subversively promoting those with a different opinion than you.    Many online news outlets occasionally close comments (or just don't open them) when the content is likely to devolve into racial or bigoted hysterics.  I've even seen it many times on Fox News, of all places, where many comment threads include KKK level nonsense.  Yet some stories elicit threads too vile even for them.  ADN is making an effort to improve the civility of the conversation.  The problem is, some stories elicit a high degree of incivility from otherwise civil citizens.  ADN is taking the easy way out here, but I don't really blame them.  They don't have the staff or inclination to moderate these topics, so they very occasionally take a pass.	0

But in the state like Hawaii it's an important deduction for the middle class as well.   Payroll taxes. We should deduct all of it and not just a portion.   And I would start paying taxes at the minimum wage rate rather than at $15,000. More like over $20,000 a year.	0

His fate of unemployment was predictable as it would be if you or I had decided to make political statements at work & irritate paying customers. The NFL being what it is, he may have gotten some leeway had he played at the star level he has in the past. He didn't.  Showing up for work with his "cops as pigs" socks was also poor judgment even though Constitutionally protected expression.  No one is stopping him, or stopped him last year, from exercising his rights. No one put him in jail. But he's not protected from the consequences of bold statements that his employer perceives as damaging to business. He could have been released based on performance, & other teams may find his performance of his job inadequate.  BTW, he IS one of the rich you disdain. He has been well compensated for both good & mediocre performance of his job.	0

537	eng_test_537	Is there a silver lining within the DPRK claim to having achieved their long sought inter continental ballistic missile IOC?  Maybe so.   We currently have a LOT of technical assets in the ROK south of the 38th parallel (e.g. the long range AN/TPY 2 radar that feeds THAAD). Ergo we are in an excellent position to do some valuable research including the harvesting of [1] GPS launch site coordinates in the  DPRK and [2] some vital sigint signature data emitted during that most valuable (vulnerable) part of their ICBM flight regime, the launch/climb out phase BEFORE the bird goes exo-atmospheric. By applying these data we can sharpen and refine our missile intercept capability ashore, aboard ship and in low earth orbit to the point where we might well be able to destroy these SNDV blooms soon after launch instead of trying to pick them off in space or even worse in the brief terminal phase after warhead re-entry on its way to the desired ground zero on our homeland.

A bank robbery without any access to the safe will net you that.   Hell gas station and fast food places will net you that.

The suffering of the individual matters not as the great press benefits for the totalitarian religious dictators supercedes any human pain.  A child suffering a devastating condition used as a poster child for religious dogma certification feeding on the emotional dysfunction of parents blind to the child's needs over their own sense of loss and guilt.  The disgusting displays by politicians and religious "leaders(not)" led by a Pope denying all human access to contraception, sex education, and end of life choices stirring the insanity of a brainwashed populace.

I then ask, wouldn't you prefer to go out and make a better life for you and your family, and the answer is "no" it's too difficult to make it and you gotta work too hard.

I've also noticed that the majority of wireless industry people or supported by telecommunication industry are all promoting RF radiation and 'relying' (making money) from outdated 1998 ICNIRP safety guidelines also a crux for our  SA Department of 'Health'.

650	eng_test_650	Back to the subject of this column: First, there were about 48 million without ins before O'Care and 29 million without after O'Care. In 2015, US life expectancy dropped for the first time in 20 years. There has also been in incease in doctor errors re: txt of pt's.  Second, the wealthy and all middle income Americans will benefit by the new H/C bill in that it terminates the increases in taxes which were positioned to take effect in 2018 and continue in order to pay for Medicaid and subsidize lower income families. So, what is called a gift to the rich is simply a liberal lie. O'Care had already penalized almost ALL taxpayers, middle to high, by increasing their tax burdens to pay more for people who can't (in some cases) or won't (in others)!

697	eng_test_697	The problem is stated in the article quite clearly.   Producers are figuring out how to release vast quantities of gas in fewer wells.  I was on a 5 well pad today and was talking to the operator. He told me how much they were producing from just 5 wells and it was enough to feed a small processing plant.   Put another way, each well was producing as much gas as 5 or more wells produced 5-10 years ago.  Even at today's low prices these producers are quite profitable.  But this vast surge in production in the 'deep basin' and 'montney' formations is quickly exceeding existing pipeline capacity.	0

A few years ago I went on a trip, shut down the house, used no electricity and the impact on my bill was minimal.  I still paid all these fixed costs.  In other words, conservation does not really reduce my bill. So the first change would be give me a small fixed charge and then charge me for the power I use.  That way, if I use less, I pay less.  2. For industry get rid of the "peak power" charge.  Hydro argues that if a company turns on a large load (say a big motor) then Hydro has to have the ability to meet this peak load.  They charge a huge amount for this peak load even if it is a few minutes.  This is another example where simply charging a reasonable rate for power used would save businesses a fortune.	0

803	eng_test_803	Hey Les, among the things I dislike - no, make that despise - are hypocrits, opportunists, bigots and bullies.  In other words, Trump and his supporters.

804	eng_test_804	Ok, let me try it another way then - I've got 2 glasses of water in front of you and 2 identical digital TDS meters; I dip the TDS meters into the glasses of water, 1 in each glass; 1 meter reads 142, the other reads 0. Million dollar QUESTION: Which water would you like to drink?  (Realize that as early as my first comment here I've already dismissed the argument of tap vs. bottle - people who want THAT argument can read the article; I'm moving past that to a new and I think more salient question: are you satisfied with your tap water?)	0

The hypocrisy of the hijacked Republican Party, along with the now completely irrelevant Evangelicals, who eagerly climbed into bed with the devil, knows no bounds. A laughing stock if it weren't for the crying over the dearth of decency, and the divisive, guttural garbage coming from what I can only describe as a mentally ill candidate, hell-bent on creating a new (facist) Trump Party, who says: 'to the devil' with all decent Republicans, who have already bravely disenfranchised themselves from what will go down in history as the most disgraceful presidential candidate ever. Make your stand Alaska. Your vote is "Wheat from the Chaff" time, so stand up and be counted!	1
818	eng_test_818	You are ignorant, Bill. Niggardly is a middle English word that means "miserly" or "lacking in generosity", and predates the "N-word" by centuries. The two words aren't related. Today you posted that you don't know what radon is, yet you continue to challenge the science of climate modelling as though you knew any science, which you obviously don't. You don't know science even at a high school level. Now, out of ignorance, you accuse me of using a racist word which has nothing to do with race. You do that out of pure ignorance.  You are completely ignorant of the law. You insist that undocumented Mexicans (that's what we are talking about here) are not only criminals, which they are not; you insist that they are racists, robbers and murderers. You said so plainly. You are a bigot.  Nor can you read. What Motley posted said clearly that first offenders in violation of specific immigration laws MAY BE tried on misdemeanor charges. Clearly they are not criminals, they are in violation.	1

823	eng_test_823	this is a very confusing article, not sure what the message is but it is not really about Jordan and gates; the problem between them appear to be an example that the writer uses to denigrate sanders and his supporters who believe that the dnc rigged the primary process.   and that sanders supporters presumably democrats were supporting someone who is not a democrat but a professed socialists who was using the democratic party to further his misguided principles.  hence, in a sense sanders rigged or tricked the democratic party into allowing him to run as a democrat while not really being one and using it for his own personal and political ambitions.  This ruse was unfair, yet the sanders supporter including vandeveer and finger flipping kent failed to understand or if they did, did not care because of their hypocrisy charging that the dnc rigged the primaries in favor of Hillary.  two wrongs don't make a right.	0

831	eng_test_831	I completely disagree.  A quality low cost public education system is the foundation of a free and healthy society. It has helped raise the masses out of poverty in America. I agree there are areas that need improvement, and do believe the states should have more autonomy, and money should be sent from the Federal level without so many restrictions. If education were privatized, it would become another funding stream for the wealthy, and that is exactly what Trump and his allies are trying to do.	0

Given your displayed hostility toward higher education, I'm going to go out on a limb and ask you exactly how much experience you've had in higher ed, which seems relevant given your apparent lack of knowledge demonstrated by your belief that education doesn't make one think.

850	eng_test_850	"In older people, he noted, blood-sugar levels normally rise as the pancreas produces less insulin and the body becomes more insulin-resistant. "  Normally? "Typically" perhaps, but rising blood sugar is not normal. What we call type two diabetes is simply a later stage condition of prolonged hyperinsulinemia. Perhaps the best diagnostic test is the 5-hour test of serum insulin as part of a glucose tolerance test. An exaggerated insulin response or delayed insulin clearance indicates the disease condition has started. The body is struggling to metabolise carbohydrates at that point.  Recent studies suggest some 75% of American adults have insulin resistance.  The simple solution is to reduce the insulin load on the body. This can be done easily through a shift in diet away from foods with higher insulin load (especially added sugar) and moderate exercise after meals, to make the insulin process more efficient.	0

957	eng_test_957	On the other side of the coin:  "A judge has reopened a major legal controversy by ruling that accused people can claim they were too drunk to be found culpable of committing crimes. Presiding over a sexual assault case in Southwestern Ontario, Mr. Justice Terrence Patterson of the Superior Court of Ontario ruled that Parliament violated the Charter of Rights with a 1995 law that prohibits the so-called defence of excessive intoxication. The ruling opened the door for Carl Frederick Fleming, 62, to argue that he was too drunk to appreciate his actions when he sexually assaulted a St. Thomas, Ont., woman in 2009."  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/judge-reinstates-controversial-drunkenness-defence-in-sex-assault-case/article578863/  So, in this case one of the old boys club (aka judges) decided that a man can be too drunk to sexually assault someone..but on the other hand, a woman who is too drunk to control her own bladder can consent to sex.

962	eng_test_962	For me, the difference between Russia and China is that China, so far, seems content to make piles of money making the world's consumer products and has no westward expansionist intentions.  Putin appears to want to expand his sphere of influence as much as possible – to regain the lost Soviet territory at the very least.  So while China is possibly worse in terms of the treatment of its own citizens, Russia is a bigger danger to the rest of us.  As for "objective", is it really being too subjective to base one's opinion on years of past experience? Russia under Putin is not a fair-minded operator. It is very much out for its own interests and comfortable being as ruthless as necessary.	0

When rates were higher, borrowers took on less debt so a 1 or 2% increase in their mortgage rates not only caused a lesser percentage increase in the rate., but it was on a much lower amount of debt. Today, someone with an $800,000  mortgage outstanding facing an increase in mortgage rate from 3 to 5% faces a much larger increase to their payments than someone in the past who was facing an increase from 10 to 12% on $150,000.	0

986	eng_test_986	I will stand by my statement that liberalism is what smart looks like to stupid people.   The letter states the real problem clearly enough. " It doesn't matter if it was protected by the First Amendment." I have legal news flash for the University of Oregon. Because the University is public and receives government tax dollars it is indeed bound to abide by the US constitution with All OF IT'S PROTECTION INCLUDED. Which should  tell everyone right off the signatories are anti-American, and perhaps even anti-America in their twisted PC nonsense.

996	eng_test_996	Almost every week I read gov Walker is spending more and more on this estimated cost $45 - $65 billion dollar gas line project at a time he is doing his damnedest to take the PFD, initiate and increase taxes, Continuing oil subsidies, hiring contractors left and right while a hiring freeze is inforce. Buying TransCanada's intrest in the gas line at $45 million. Doing the exact opposite of what he said he would do if elected. My observation is he is hell bent on this gas pipeline and doesnt give a damn what Alaskans think. Sounds just like Frank Murkowski and the  lear jet he bought, and said he didnt give a damn if Alaskans liked it or not. These Governors need to start careing what Alaskans want. Do what you were elected to do: TRIM THE GOVERNMENT SPENDING! That includes the natural gas pipeline until is at least until we have a ballanced budget.

That's the point, she had the email from her doctor specifiying her need for the animal which is all that's required.  These people wanted to know the reason for her need of the dog and that's NONE OF THEIR DAMN BUSINESS.  Now this is what will happen.  I know from personal experience. Quite a few ppl will be fired because crap rolls downhill.

1021	eng_test_1021	Sorry, but sales is not a discipline that requires much study. Speaking from experience, most sales people don't take sales training, or sales trainers, very seriously. Sales training is mostly a conflation of motivational speakers and pop psychology 'analytics'. Real sales people focus on building relationships using their personality assets, manipulation skills, and goal-oriented drive. Sometimes, keeping 'ethics' at a safe distance helps too.  I worked for the 2nd largest computer company during the 80s and 90s selling very large computer systems and services to 'Fortune 100' corporations. We were frequently subjected to sales training courses and had to attend retreats at hotels, off-season resorts, and even college campuses. It was mostly meaningless and tedious, but often we had some pretty good blowouts with plenty of expense account paid drinking, fancy dining and flirting. Universities could never come to grips with that sort of expense and debauchery for mere students.	0

I saw several comments from people who don't seem to appreciate how valuable a civil servant of Ms Freeland's caliber is at the international level. It is clear they know nothing about her and are only speaking blithely and recklessly from their ideological bias. This is both sad and unfortunate, because right now we need people to pay attention and speak from knowledge.

1053	eng_test_1053	A major failure of the University of Alaska statewide system is a lack of a school of architecture anywhere in Alaska. We’re one of the few states without one. In the West, Idaho is the only other lacking entity although they have architectural engineering programs, and they’re on the interstate highway system where their citizens can access other architecture schools in nearby states. There’s no way Alaska would have had a school of architecture back in the 50s when Fairbanks was “blossoming,” but there also have been many architectural catastrophes in Alaska since then too. This is yet another “be careful what you ask for” Alaska architectural train wreck. Across Fairbanks town--they also have the UAF Fine Arts Complex, which has screamed out for repairs from architectural hemmorhaghing ever since that place originated decades ago. Very expensive, very much from Alaska's treasury, money money money.	0

1110	eng_test_1110	Thank goodness Suzette Cook will finally be gone.  When Jim White was mayor, the downtown districts were clean and well maintained.  Street sweepers would come through once per week, and gravel shoulders in the residential portion were maintained. Under Suzette Cook, the people living in the downtown area have been neglected.  People who complained about the lack of maintenance were told the could levy a special improvement tax on themselves if they wanted things fixed.  The roads in the area I live in are in extremely poor condition.  I've not seen any maintenance since Cook took office.  Suzette Cook was more interested in the industrial parks than the neighborhoods of Kent.   I'll be closely watching what the mayoral candidates have to say about working for the residents.

1121	eng_test_1121	John, in the earth's history, the CO2 concentration has been much higher than it is today, as has the global temperature.  Also, the CO2 emitted by volcanic activity dwarfs that  emitted by humans.  Thus, I don't see the rationale for saying, "it should be kept between 250 and 350 ppm."  No one has any idea what is the "proper" concentration; indeed, there is no such thing.  The earth and its atmosphere is a gigantic feedback mechanism.  For example, increases in CO2 concentration increase photosynthesis, which converts CO2 to O2 and glucose.  Also, the oceans are a major absorber of CO2 (and no, it does not make the oceans "acidic"--a politicized term--the ph always stays above 7.0), where it gets incorporated into tissue and hard shells of marine organisms and/or dissolved in the polar regions and circulated into the deep oceans.  Increased CO2 concentration results in increased absorption.  I'm frankly more worried about global cooling due to reduced solar activity.	0

But then in DSM-IV, the APA changed its criteria, stating that pedophilia was ONLY a "disorder" if it “caused clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning.”  The APA organ Psychological Bulletin published the Rind study:  finding that man-boy “consensual” relationships were not necessarily harmful. Subsequent to the public outcry related to the Rind study, APA said moral values trumped the scientific study. In the original printing of DSM-5, “pedophilia” was changed to a “sexual orientation,” but another public outcry led APA to admit an “error” that was to be "corrected" in “the next printing of the manual.” And now they say that Trump is crazy, and that they are credible.

How are readers supposed to discern valid writing from just print which fills up pages in a news source when drivel like what is quoted above is printed?  Realtors are required to comply with Fintrac imposed anti-money laundering laws.  We cannot even submit listings or mandates to our offices unless the Fintract forms are duly filled out and submitted.  The quotation is gratuitous fluff that belies a lack of understanding of the real estate industry and diminishes the credibility of the writer.  Secondly, it perpetuates the malicious myth that Realtors as a class of profession have practiced their profession in a collectively deficient way so as to be a root cause of money laundering.  This is a false premise.    Can the writer point out any cases where Fintrac reporting violations on the part of Realtors has lead to successful prosecution?	0

1244	eng_test_1244	After reading through all of the comments to this op/ed, I went back and re-read it to see if I had "missed" something.  What I get when I read this is, a opinion about a large, rich corporation that went after attorney fees in a case that they were not being sued.  I took this op/ed to be about how going after the legal fees for the Corporation who was never sued. However, there was another piece of land (separate from this case) that the Corporation took issue with but the Corporation LOST in that case.  The op/ed is talking about how a big corporation used a case they were not being sued in to get the fees as a retaliation for the other case and as a way to intimidate anyone who would dare take on the Corporation. Why is that important ? Because a number of shareholders are very unhappy right now and allege that there is wrong doing by  Corporation board. That this ruling will be used to let the shareholders know that if you try to take on the Corp, the Corp will win at all costs.	0

However, even if I was, there are multiple doctors that have contracts in Alaska to treat sex offenders and they all, including DOC, have a consensus on the accuracy of the statistics in this report.   Second, under reporting and recidivism isn't necessarily the same thing. To my understanding, the assailants in a good portion of under reported incidents are not prior convicted and treated sex offenders. They may have multiple victims on multiple occasions but these numbers largely reflect people who have not yet been caught. Once caught and rehabilitated THEN the rate at which they reoffend is much lower than general crimes.   I really hope you don't think I am defending sex offenders over victims. To make myself clear, I feel for victims of sexual assault, my wife was trafficked at a young age by her own father. But we both have the opinion...	0

The EO person quoted in the article was speaking only about access to rental facilities, not about requiring anyone in any venue to perform a same-sex wedding. Moreover, it is not even clear from the LifeSite article that the position articulated by the EO official is the position of EO itself. The context of the article is the Pastor Protection Act (PPA), purporting to protect a right which no-one is attacking.

1289	eng_test_1289	Where do you dig up this crap, Agirl, and why do you buy into it? Do you have a clue?  True, the segregationists in Congress and Southern state government were Democrats out of tradition, but they were called "Dixiecrats" to distinguish them from progressive Northern Democrats in the FDR mold. Lyndon Johnson was a Texas Dixiecrat and known bigot who nevertheless nurtured and signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which killed Jim Crow, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which largely ended black voter disenfranchisement, primarily in the South. After 1964 and particularly after Lee Atwater's Southern Strategy got Reagan elected, Dixiecrats switched their party loyalty to Republican. Today their are very few Democrats in Southern state government.  Your revisionist history is garbage, crafted to lure the ignorant toward racial hatred by making progressivism out to be evil. You are on the side of bigotry.	1

It's just an observation, but it seems to me like he's trying too hard.

1311	eng_test_1311	As a server in Portland for over 20 years I can say this concept frightens me. I've raised my son as a single mom on my income, comprised largely of tips. And that isn't to say we have lived in the lap of luxury! We've still had to get food stamps and other services at times over the years. But it's been a living, and I've worked! Very hard! to develop a skill set that earns me decent tips. Never once in this industry have I ever been given a raise unless minimum went up. Now if you tell me my tips are going to be absorbed by the owners and redistributed as they see fit, I wonder why I , or any other server worth their salt would want to do that job? Am I getting a raise to 16 dollars an hour? And the argument of cooks and other BOH staff not making enough doesn't move me either. Every job I've worked I've tipped out to support staff, who make more than I do hourly, and get raises. Plus, they don't want to work with the public! FOH earns tips by servicing customers... it's not easy!	0

Then Bannon spewed out some word salad for Trump to further butcher in an attempt to deny it. They came up with the empty 'isolationism' that Trump immediately denied when he met with Merkel. Trump never had any foreign policy, other than looking to skim money wherever he could. He's got no comprehensive intelligent policy on immigration except to push his xenophobic racist ideas. He's a petty con man, not an actual reasoned or sane human being, he's a fraud. He's imbalanced, unfit for office. Now we have a weak and insecure, belligerent child who imagines himself a fascist saviour. He's no more than an egotistical juvenile buffoon.

There are some serious concerns about global warming on the horizon and also about the state of the economy and the world. And with the President elect we have to wonder what this world is coming to.   The point about winter is that despite the negative effects of it, you have to stay positive and look for the good parts of it to enjoy. These include the winter sports that Canada is famous for. So is getting out for a nice walk that informs one that the cold and the snow isn't so bad once you acclimatize to it and accept it for what it is.  It becomes just another season that has it's conditions and requirements that one needs to adjust to. Just like politics.

He has admitted his affection for both China and Cuba and the advantages of the Chinese form of government. Just like great communist before him he pits the working class against the rich. Standard fair for communist wannabees. In 1848, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels published the Communist Manifesto, which called on workers of the world, or the proletariat (JUSTIN'S SO CALLED MIDDLE CLASS), to unite against the bourgeoisie (HIS SO CALLED ONE PERCENTS) , the rich and powerful at the expense of the workers. Marx understood that communism could arise in countries with these two classes present if polarised properly. Justin and Butt's also understand this, they are using the same strategy to cloud the their real agenda. Because of this ideology how much they tax us is secondary to advancing their new Utopian view of Canadian politics. They don't care about us...just the cause.	0

1386	eng_test_1386	Of course under the secretive net profits SB-21, BP can now make a killing off of Alaskans with this deal.  Here is how it works.  1.  Sell the building to a subsidiary.  2.  Lease the building from its subsidiary at a very, very high price.  3.  Write off these inflated expenses against the oil it removes from Alaska.   Presto, BP makes millions more than they would if they'd just simply maintained its existing ownership of the building.  A technique very similar to this has been employed with the oil pipeline ownership for decades.	0

It has been common knowledge, and the subject of many advertising campaigns, for DECADES. EVERYONE knows that if you get high, many places won't hire you. The bus ride to the job center takes an hour and a half? Boo...HOO. If you're unemployed, you have a lot of time on your hands, and your number one priority should be to get a job. Get on the bus. Less reliable, consistent internet access? I call BS. Every few minutes during my commute to and from work, MOST of the homeless I see holding signs also have smart phones. Show me one teenager who DOESN'T have a web enabled device. The "digital divide" is a myth. Companies won't hire felons? GOOD! Think about that before you commit your crime.

1407	eng_test_1407	The fact that the Orange Geezer has categorically denied that this could possibly be true, without any basis for knowing one way or the other, is highly suspicious. How could it possibly be to his advantage to deny the link? The claim, all along, was not that the Russians won the election for him. The claim was always only that the Russians hacked and meddled in the election.   The fact that the geezer's camp desperately wants this to go away suggests that they have something to hide and/or that they are completely insecure and paranoid about the validity of the election. Time will tell which of these is the case. Either way, Trump is looking like a chump and a fool.	1

It amazes me how some can be so outraged about a stupid comment by the Trumpster and then lose their moral compass and common sense when it comes to Hillary.  Trump is bad, Hillary is worse.

If these were all random stranger rapes, ya think that would be the first thing you would include with the story!! Your own article says it's a serial rapist, stranger attacks, and dates back to at least 2001. How would any other victim be able to come forward without a photo? This guy needs to be in jail for life. And not in segregation. Needs a frequent taste of his own medicine. Why sexual predators get special treatment in jail to try to prevent them from being raped is ludicrous and beyond belief. Mark them as sex offenders and put them in general pop.	1

1466	eng_test_1466	Let's turn the tables for a moment.  Suppose you have standing to be a plaintiff in a case that restricts abortion. You go to the ACLU- who is in the business of civil rights litigation- and demand they represent you in a case that, if upheld, will restrict abortion.  Would they take your case?  Of course not. It conflicts with their beliefs. So why is this different for a baker?  Well, because as a plaintiff you have more than an arm's length transaction. You will probably deposit a retainer. You will sign a representation agreement. And so on.  You would be a CLIENT. Businesses refuse clients all the time. By taking a deposit for a specific cake for a specific customer for a specific ceremony for a specific day, the baker is taking on a CLIENT. That is materially different than a customer pulling a cupcake off the shelf.  I hope the courts are able to make this distinction.	0

1511	eng_test_1511	Campaigning 24/7 has become more of a priority than governing to these political parties.  Canada is suffering from this kind of manipulation of our democratic processes.  Political parties are destroying democracy in Canada and Canadians need to take control of how they are run or demand to get rid of them all together.  Independent MPs would be more concerned about their constituents than the party line. This infighting could be brought to a halt.     Elections should be paid for in full by tax payers.  Every candidate gets a set amount of dollars to level the playing field and stop the political donation rebates all together.  That would mitigate the power political parties have over our electoral system.	0
1512	eng_test_1512	Why get married in the first place if there is so little trust at the outset?  And the non-repayable part, after the marriage either lasts to a milestone, or after the parents who gave die...the fastest growing category of divorces (according to this paper) are the mid-late life ones..  So two people get married in their 20's, get a big gift from one side, and then divorce 30 years later, after being married for a long time, as well as seeing the "givers" die...the undeserving spouse you were so worried about "wins" anyway...  You cannot control the future..	0
1513	eng_test_1513	The malignant narcissist and mentally deficient sociopath is not only a bigot, a racist, a closet fascist and a draft-dodging warmonger. He is a blustering pathological liar without shame, disingenuous, dishonest, divisive, immoral, incompetent, inept, unethical, unstable, untrustworthy, and unfit. His stupid, intemperate remarks precisely define his personality. This wannabe president has no idea of how to represent this country, domestically or internationally, and is viewed poorly by members of his own party, as well asby many foreign leaders.    What may be even more contemptible are the GOP sycophants and boot licks in his administration and Congress who allow this pathetic charade to continue, and his glassy-eyed fans who believe he can do no wrong. The sooner this dishonorable political degenerate is out, the sooner the country can recover from his foul stain on our history.   We are living in a kakistocracy.

Trudeau has lied to Canadians, broken countless promises and has openly admitted to breaking our laws. Not only is Trudeau the first prime minister in Canadian history to ever be under investigation by the conflict-of-interest and ethics commissioner for breaking our federal laws but he's also under investigation by the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages.  He managed to get away with physically shoving around a female politician in the House of Commons and for breaking our immigration laws by not deporting Monsef for illegally entering Canada under a falsified application after deporting hundreds of others for the exact same reason. Truly the truth is the Liberals biggest enemy, if Trudeau had a shred of moral integrity  he would step down.	0

1633	eng_test_1633	Fred, while I understand your hatred of anything Israeli, I do know that you are not devoid of accepting factual information. I fully agree that Israel attacked first, after the provocations I outlined above. Yes, they did claim that Egypt attacked first, then admitted that they had done a preemptive attack. However, The USS liberty was off the northern coast of the Sinai, about 25 nm NW of El Arish. That would put the Liberty about 175 miles SW of the Golan Heights. The technology of the time would have allowed the Liberty to monitor local theater communications, an area about 60 to 75 miles from their location but in no way would they have been able to intercept tactical communications anywhere close to the Golan Heights. The Syrians, falsely led to believe the Egyptians were winning huge, began an offensive against Israel on June 5th, using artillery and their Air Force along with a limited ground offensive. They failed miserably. The Liberty attack was on June 8th.	0

1637	eng_test_1637	That is a very creative view.  No state, or the federal government has taken that view. Alexander Hamilton wrote in 1788: "If circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude, that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens." "A widespread fear, during the debates on ratifying the Constitution, was the possibility of a military takeover of the states by the federal government, which could happen if the Congress passed laws prohibiting states from arming citizens, or prohibiting citizens from arming themselves."	0

1642	eng_test_1642	Your comment is ridiculous. Child protection laws in Canada  are unaffected by this bill. More importantly, there is the legal definition of "the age of reason" or age of Majority and Accountability, at which an individual is deemed legally able to make life-changing decisions for themselves...such as driving, drinking, voting, or smoking. In general, that is between the ages of 16 and 18.  A 6 year old child in Canada doesn't have the legal right to make decisions for themselves; what makes you believe, in any credible way, that any court or agency in the country would think a 6 year old (who, legally, isn't even considered mature enough to form the intent to commit a crime) should nevertheless be removed from its family because its wishes regarding gender weren't being respected by its parents? That's a farcical notion bordering on fear mongering. Go back and rethink your argument.	0

1644	eng_test_1644	What a bunch of IDIOTS. The most fair and COLLECTIBLE tax is a SALES TAX.  The success of a tax is if it is widespread, can be enforced easily and is paid by those who actually purchase goods and services.  The fewer collectors of a tax the better, and there are much fewer businesses to collect a sales tax than there are residents, who may or may not honestly pay an income tax There are a LOT of income tax cheaters and to enforce collection of income tax requires a new State agency.  Auditing businesses who collect sales tax is very straightforward and very few businesses of any size cheat on sales taxes.  As a person increases their income, they buy more expensive items, therefore they pay more sales tax, Most states eliminate groceries from sales tax, so as to not unfairly hit the poor, so the sales tax is on items people CHOOSE to buy. Rich people buy planes, expensive cars, expensive homes, expensive "toys", remodel homes, buy new appliances, etc. and therefore pay more sales tax.	0

So I just copy and paste the deleted comment back in the appropriate place in the thread. If I had to type the whole thing out again I wouldn't bother. I reckon that if it was the moderators who had deleted it then they would do so again and if that happened I'd leave it at that. I only do it with comments that are long and have taken time to form and take care that they are not uncivil. I don't rate other people's comments as uncivil as I don't feel I have the right to be a 'thread policeman'. If someone wants to block a comment then they only remove it from their own vision, censoring a comment by rating it uncivil removes it from everybody's vision which I think is unfair.

1694	eng_test_1694	A derogatory comment, term or phrase can be foul language...In fact, it is in most cases. Also those assumptions you made about Dad being a drill sergeant who didn't ever take the time to take the boy to the park is pretty far reaching. Typically a "drill sergeant" type parent are not the types of parents who write to advise columns wanting to know where they may have stepped over the line. I typically find that push over parents who have spoiled their children have issues once they try to enforce any boundary. Their children are so use to just running the ship that once a parent shows they have had enough the child disengauges and feels that since they no longer can do or say anything they want, they now have no reason to be around especially if they can do whatever they want at the other parents house.If this dad was so hard to deal with this son wouldn't be run off by dad asking him to mind his launguage at the dinner table.

I think however that changes - especially putting a lot of people from disparate groups together (especially in highly populated areas like European countries) in a very short period of time is a recipe for disaster.  Even in Canada it might get iffy - how the heck do you 'hybridize' groups when 100s of thousands enter already high density cities every year? You don't.  Ethnic silos arise.   And that's where the problem begins.    We must mingle and move and change.  But having so much change forced upon people so quickly by their governments and other interest groups is NOT the way to do it.	0

The problem arises when you forecast status quo, which might say 110-115 mpbd by 2025, vs reality (likely the 100mpbd), meaning that about 10mbpd of capacity is put out of business.

1710	eng_test_1710	The theory of globalization is that all parties are rational actors following capitalist principles of maximizing return on investment. China appears to be following the principle of maximizing employment rather than ROI. The result has been, from our point of view,  massive Chinese malinvestment which disrupts rational competitive pricing in world trade. Western governments should have dealt with this before and perhaps Trump will, but I won't hold my breath.  That said, I suspect that automation, not globalization, is the real issue behind the loss of jobs in developed economies and perhaps the move to low wage manufacturing countries really just slowed its rate of implementation.	0

1723	eng_test_1723	Firstly, whatever Bishop Williamson's views were re: the Holocaust, he was a validly albeit illicitly ordained bishop when he made them public. His views only became public long after his ordination and there is no precedent for the absolute revocation of Holy Orders, a bishop is Sacerdos in æternum. If I wish to deny the holocaust then am I not entitled to my belief?  Austria and Germany have sinister legislation which can gaol you for what you think. If I believe the world is flat or that the sun revolves around the earth is that sinful? Four bishops were consecrated validly but illicitly and therefore incurred excommunication because their ordinations were not sanctioned by the Pope. Benedict decided to lift the excommunications and even had he known that Williamson denied the holocaust he could not have left him out as he was not excommunicated on account of his views on the holocaust.	0

Can it realistically be said that the consumer turned his or her mind to all the terms and gave meaningful consent?”  Well what it means for the Globe and Mail, is if you do not respond in the "right" way as to whether or not someone's else's commentary is civil or not, even if the full comment is shortened for brevity and you do not have timely access to the entire conversation, then you may lose all rights to join in any future conversation, on any topic.

1738	eng_test_1738	Respectfully THOSF, I always save my Colorado mail-in ballots, as I don't even open them up a lot of times. If you do go vote in person here in Denver, the first thing they ask for is a state ID or driver license to verify the person and the address before they print out a ballot. I once, a few years back, tried to tell them I had no ID to see how they'd respond, they get all upset, and told me I needed one in order to vote here in Denver. I didn't push it, but I believe if I had, I'd have been given a different type of ballot, one to be counted long after the election once verified.  Secondly, mail-ins can be checked by signature match I do believe when verification is questioned, people steal mail everyday in today's world. I use separate signatures professionally, one for the mundane every day stuff, the other articulated for security verification. I don't trust mail-in's either.

I'm really only saying that the range of public attitudes (and even the strength of various ideologies) is more broadly similar in Canada to those in Europe than Canadians are generally prepared to admit.  I'm not suggesting that the uglier elements should be suppressed or silenced provided that they do not engage in criminal activity or otherwise interfere with the civil rights and safety of others.  I too would prefer to see these elements out in the open where they can be opposed democratically in moderate ways.    While proportional representation and other systems that ensure that a broader array of opinions attain some formal elected representation have many merits, I suggest that we not go too far in those directions and give anti-democratic elements an entry to exercise power and influence beyond their real standing in Canada.	0

Now global capitalism and broken democracy throw "market based solutions" at everything.  If the US government in all its power and might manages to raid a few boats and free some slaves that would be an accomplishment.  But asking for an overall decrease in slavery - from the people who work on boats, to farm workers that pick tomatoes, to kids who make everything at Walmart, to children soldiers and prostitutes, etc., will not come from the large multinational companies.  It'll come from the grassroots taking back democracy globally and demanding change, as well as the return of trade unionism as a countervailing force.  Both will check and regulate the unbridled capitalism.	0

Houston is working on getting away with it for the current flooding where they knew it was a risk but didn't take reasonable steps to mitigate those risks.  The history of flood insurance is one of moral risk.  The question becomes since we have bailed out many areas over the years how can we say no to this one?  For Sandy it was easy for the Texas GOP representatives to say no because it was all those rich liberals up there in New England.

1820	eng_test_1820	In my experience with my Subaru, studless winter tires with the mountain/snowflake symbol are BETTER than studded tires, even in the worst conditions that we get.  That's even with the cheap ones, like $50 Firestone WinterForce tires.  You don't have to go to Bridgestone Blizzaks, Michelin X-Ice, or similar more expensive studless tires.  The mountain/snowflake symbol is the way to identify proper winter tires.  Tires with this symbol are required in the winter in BC and some other places in Canada.  We should just ban studded tires, phasing them out over several years, like a lot of other places do.

Trudeau's ill concieved promise of a few budgets of $10 billion deficit for 'infrastructure' has given way to bloated largesse. To do this at at time of positive GDP growth is farsical, unwise and even irresponsible.   Trudeau may have captured the star struck hearts of many but plenty of us still recall the painful '90s when Chretien and Martin finally pushed us back from the brink of fiscal crush with large tax increases and large spending cuts.    Careful Justin, you're on a dangerous path.	0

Twenty years later, we even got to vote.  This leaves a bit of a mark on one's psyche.....	0

Elway, of all people, understand that all too well...

That legislator cannot be voted out of office except by his or her constituents so every other Alaskan is effectively disenfranchised by this action.

1941	eng_test_1941	Personally, the major variable for me is that the only candidate that the Democrats would run with was Hillary with all of her and Bill's 30 years of baggage.  From the DNC on down to the precinct level and the extra Democratic delegates, they insisted that she was the one who had  to be anointed.    Your position is clearly supported by the fact that the 16 others on the Republican ticket could not appeal to the elite or to their rank and file, however.

1967	eng_test_1967	Gary, as an old liberal myself I'm surprised at your attempt to equalize the ranting of Trump with those who have been critical of Prof. Schurtz's blackface performance.  Until a review of this case has been published I'll avoid an opinion, though it's  obvious the idea of firing a senior tenured professor was ridiculous.  At the same time, lets' remember that with campus politics, a party at a senior prof's home is hardly "private."  While not everyone who comments here would agree, most historians would agree with Pres. Schill's immediate response that "The use of blackface, even in jest at a Halloween party is patently offensive  and reinforces  historically racist stereotypes."  Three questions I hope will be answered by the investigation are,  1. If any minorities were invited, how did they feel?  2. If any junior faculty or law students were present, would they have felt safe criticizing her performance?  3. What does her long vita reveal about her interest in racial diversity?	0

The shooting of black people by the police are incomparable to shootings of white people pm e by police. Forget black on black or white people, this is about oppression.

Publishing them without any "verification" of the facts, gives the likes of you and I the opportunity to step forward and say, "Hey, wait a minute!" and expose the idiocy. So, a great service, no?  Speaking of idiocy...I found this amusing: The former editor says, "Social media has let loose all kinds of dark instincts that were lurking. When you thought it was just your own dark thoughts, and there was nobody who shared them, maybe you wouldn't have been so loud about them. But when you find there are a whole bunch of people who agree, it does give you volume."  Social media doesn't care about the type of thoughts or instincts. Neither does MSM. It disseminates EVERYTHING, "dark" or "light."  And without social media, who would read/see/hear feminists' thoughts?  Well, there'd be "nobody who shared them," and nobody'd know that "there are a whole bunch of people who agree."  The height of irony.	1

So, first thing is that the tax on marijuana should be at least as high as that on tobacco, if not higher.  Second thing is that penalties associated with "actions while under the influence" should more stringent than any associated with alcohol as I've been told that one gets higher quicker and more so with marijuana than with alcohol.	0

2049	eng_test_2049	I'd lean towards saying that AST is on the hook for policing the area. While Girdwood is inside the municipality, the MOA can't force APD officers on Girdwood unless Girdwood accepts the alteration to the metropolitan police service area. The city is expressly barred from altering it without a vote of the affected people.  AST however is required under Alaska Statute to police the whole state regardless of anything else. Therefore if a crime were committed, AST would have the statutory requirement to be the lead investigative agency.	0

2052	eng_test_2052	Oh come on TDW, wake up man, when in the 50's, 60's 70's and even the 80's did you find luxury or upscale trucks. Now they are a dime a dozen. Half the clowns that own them want every conceivable luxury appointment and are afraid to get the box dirty.  Some on here often call those who spend 50 or 60 grand on a Mercedes as fools but to me the biggest group of fools are those who spend that on a truck.	1
2053	eng_test_2053	First thank you. I did read that article and I had not seen it  before.   But second, I happen to know folks who sell health insurance. What ties their hands is the High Cost of getting licensed state by individual state. It was what they tried to tell Congress during ACA creation, to no avail. In a open market, businesses compete if they have 'like' businesses around them. It results in normally lower costs for the consumer. Open the competition up across state lines. The more companies competing the better for us.   Second, address Medical Malpractice lawsuits. That insurance the doctors carry drives up our costs per visit.  Quite often, bogus claims are settled out of court, as it is cheaper than defending the practitioner. Change that by one thing-the losing party pay all court costs, all legal fees. That will give pause to ambulance chasers.	0

2055	eng_test_2055	Thus is the mindset of former politicians, and liberals who believe that bigger and bigger Government interference and control is the answer to everything.  This mindset is one of the reasons that 'Governments' that have the power to tax always have a bloated and wasteful budget.    If the Theater is so nice and neat, all of those who like it need to get their hands out of their neighbors pockets and dig in their own.  Form a LLC, buy the building and preserve it.  Leave the rest of the State out of it.	0

2065	eng_test_2065	Of course power generation costs are the result of TOU electrical pricing.  Smart meters and TOU pricing were brought in as a means of having consumers directly pay for the high contract costs the government made with wind and solar producers. Remove wind and solar from the picture and, the cost of generation drops to roughly $.0325 cents per kWh. In Ontario prior to the Liberals messing things up, we paid for electricity based on the "cost average model". Which meant everyone paid the same low price for their electricity. The same costing model used by every business in the world.  The Liberals needed wind and solar to help cement their green dream legacy. First they created the myth electricity costs more at certain times and people using that electricity should pay higher prices. Once the people believed, in came smart meters and TOU pricing. As more wind and solar projects were added, the government incrementally increased the TOU rates to cover the new contract costs.	0

2075	eng_test_2075	I predict Trump will become the most loathed political figure in the United States within 6 months and all the fake patriots who voted for him will lie to everyone they know and say they didn't vote for him. Of course, any American with half a brain--those who didn't vote for the scumbag--will know exactly who voted for this filthy traitor.

2078	eng_test_2078	Respectfully VRJ, I was always told such a threat or assertion concerning the president was a felony punishable with a federal prison sentence. But I guess some folk get a free pass, They can break our nation's laws, pick and choose which laws they obey, riot and loot when the opportunity arises such as a candidate speaking or when something they oppose like the G8 summit comes to town. It's their freedom and right to do so anymore, just like this lady talking about she wishes the president to be assassinated.        How easy it seems for succeeding generations who weren't around for the Kennedy assassinations, or woke up one morning as a kid to hear Dr. King was assassinated, to just callously throw out such phrases. As a kid, they were monumental events that were so tragic for our nation, that they remained forever etched and seared in one's memory.	0
2079	eng_test_2079	A better bet would be to maximize your investments and stop worrying about taxes. I say this because it has worked for me.

I am sure that NYU is great center of learning, but that seems to be lost on such a privileged person who attended Punahou.

2095	eng_test_2095	It is true that I believe that we must respect the lives of our fellow citizens.  I have great trouble with your comment "I would gladly have cleaned up the mess if he had followed through on his threat," which you made on this page.  The comment appears to utterly devalue the life of another citizen and in fact you have only the information from the press to support that conclusion.  Sorry, but I believe that crime itself derives directly from the tendency to devalue our fellow citizens.  The man involved may have done many good things in his life.  Yet, you are willing to condone his suicide and clean up the mess based on this one tenuous media report?  No, I am a supporter of rational criminal justice that begins with the assumption of the value of our fellow humans and aims to rationally correct deviations sans revenge or utter devaluation of life.	0

They cost us a MINIMUM OF 200 billion each year......K-12 education at 15 k each school year, ESL classes, overcrowding in schools, free medical (been to an ER lately???), 20k for popping out each illegal anchor rat, in-state tuition, incarceration in prison, judicial expenses for their false claims, use of infrastructure for free and sending BILLIONS in remittances to their country!

2107	eng_test_2107	Two things I particular sadden me about the current decisions being made by UA:  1. Targeting skiing and other small sports was a cowardly move in the first place.  The programs which were on the chopping block represented a small fraction of the UA sports budget.  The University bet that such small programs would be easy to cut because who cares about skiing anyway?  They were wrong and the skiing community put forth a show.  Which brings me to point #2.  2. It is unfortunate that the Board of Regents let the community sway their decision with promises of self support.  Exactly how long do we expect private citizens to keep interest in funding a sport up to 80%? My guess is that it might happen next season and maybe the one after that.  However, I really do not think that is a sustainable model.  None of this even touches on the elephant in the room: the hockey program.  That is the real issue which needs to be addressed.  Everything else is just fluff.	0

2109	eng_test_2109	I must have read the wrong article because the one I read said "37 caribou carcasses" were discovered with the others being harvested. I was appalled by this event as well but can you provide the statewide annual number of wanton waste cases? I tried to locate a ballpark figure but was unable.  The first commercial whaling vessel showed up in 1854 and although there was lots of trading I doubt the Inuit had any devastating impact of whale populations considering they had no vessels capable of mass harvest of whale oil.  With responsibility comes accountability and although you deem my understanding of the world as poor, I see nothing wrong with allowing the first peoples a say in the responsibility of stewardship over a resource, that for them, means sustainability.	0

2115	eng_test_2115	Goldbert, our most accomplished and learned writer on mainstream art was not inspired by this stuff to do anything besides describe it, clinically. Why?

2116	eng_test_2116	Because the "U" section of the alphabet in travel guides and tourist magazines is so stuffed to the rafters already?  The town voted to change it's name.

I'm assuming the snowflakes in question are not conservatives, as state and local autonomy is a central tenet of small government, so they must be fans of a sprawling government big enough to get in their and root out any thought- or spelling-crimes before they happen.	0

Another 14.7% are members of couples where the spouse is employed and earning more than minimum wage.  So, at most, 29% of minimum wage earners are the "primary breadwinner(s) of the family", and that figure includes couples were both spouse work for minimum wage and couples were one spouse is self-employed (so wages can't easily be calculated).	0

2155	eng_test_2155	I am reminded of Martin Luther King's "Letter From A Birmingham Jail". I am particularly reminded of this paragraph:  We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was "well timed" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word "Wait!" It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This "Wait" has almost always meant "Never." We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that "justice too long delayed is justice denied."  Substitute "homosexual" for "Negro", and it rings true in this situation.	0

2209	eng_test_2209	Another significant factor delaying discharge: the funding process for home care, assisted living, or skilled facility care. Once a patient is ready to transition (or very close), many patients need to apply for specific insurance to cover that kind of care, which is not automatic under most plans. (Just because it was considered medically necessary by a multidisciplinary team doesn't mean it was covered... but your hospital stay? That's definitely decertified now, because the team is recommending transfer to a different level of care.) The state can take 30 days to review that application once all the materials are pulled together - and it essentially -always- takes 28-30 days.  Assisted living and skilled nursing applications aren't reviewed until that funding is in place as they are in no position to hold beds indefinitely. This leads to a 2-4 week extension of hospital time on these stays, & it's not something anyone wants.	0

For example, this is a woman who once said that air on commercial planes is bad for you to breathe because airlines "pump in" 50% nitrogen (which she implied was too much) in the air, which she claimed caused all sorts of bad effects.  Nevermind that the air we breathe at sea level is made up mostly of nitrogen.  She's a scientific moron.  That's why she's controversial.  She's an idiot and a liar.  Her name would more accurately be "Food Idiot."	1
2214	eng_test_2214	Check your facts. Only the administrative assistants get more coin than the private sectors. Most Federal Public Servants are underpaid compared to the private sector. The only gold plated benefits are for the politicians and MP's. Standard benfits for the public service have been cut and they all pay the same as the private sector (some of the private sector get much better benefits) at 50/50 for the pension. One would hope people would say, hey those benefits are pretty good, I want them to in the private sector. Most large companies have similar benefit plans.	0

2217	eng_test_2217	We cannot go back to unrestrained Judicial discretion. Discretion was proven by science and experience to be biased and discriminatory. I am sure that we do not want to go back to the days where we have a disproportionate number of natives in our jails and prisons. Oh right we still do, don't we? Second, bail was used to discriminate against the poor and minorities.  Bail was and still is, as implemented, unconstitutional and out of control. Judges still add unconstitutional bail conditions aka 24 hour sight and sound 3rd party custodians and so much more. Bail should be based on risk of flight balanced with ability to pay and severity of the charge. Most bail and bail conditions are outrageous but most defendants lie about their ability to pay. Therefore, the most weight should be on flight risk. In Alaska flight risk is minimal for most offenses (for many reasons). Bail should be minimal as a result.	0

2267	eng_test_2267	A climate change study was conducted by MIT in April 2016, titled 'How much of a difference will the Paris Agreement make?'. "The research showed that if countries abided by their pledges in the deal, global warming would slow by between 0.6 degree and 1.1 degrees Celsius by 2100, Reuters reported."  Wow! A 1% slowing down of global warming after 80 years!  In other words, it would make a tiny difference.  THAT'S "IF COUNTRIES ABIDED BY THEIR PLEDGES IN THE DEAL!"  A non-binding agreement that has no teeth.  Let's see, I wonder how many countries would keep their promises when nothing would happen if they didn't.  I would bet the U.S. would be one of the stupid countries that actually kept or tried to keep their promises while the rest of the world laughed at us.

Obviously, the ink on the dossier had barely dried before Clinton‘s minions were working to spread it far and wide.  This, of course, was all giddily celebrated by the Clinton Circle in 2016 as the much anticipated “October surprise” promised by Reid.  In 2017, it is utterly damning.

2322	eng_test_2322	Does anyone have an estimate of when the ill effects of the Tier 1 system that ended in 1997 will start to be less each year? That is, when Tier 1 beneficiaries die at a faster rate than start retirement?  Hmm, looking at http://www.oregon.gov/PERS/Documents/General-Information/PERS-by-the-Numbers.pdf There are 45,000 active and inactive Tier 1 members. 23,000 are eligible to retire. That's a big percentage! But 6,000 retire (from all tiers) per year on average.  To me, then it sounds like in the next 5 years we may see most of the Tier 1 employees retire. At that point, the number of Tier 1 retirees will decrease. It may take a few years beyond that for the guaranteed deficits to not overcome the decreasing number of retirees, so within a decade the pain might start to ebb? That's a long time. Maybe we should all hope for Trump's growth stimulus on near-full employment to cause skyrocketing inflation and higher returns from investments.	0

2360	eng_test_2360	The level of scrutiny you advocate should be required of all real estate purchasers. They should have to prove that Canadian income taxes (or taxes in kind, in a country with a tax agreement with Canada) have been paid on all the money that is being brought to the purchase. This includes "gifts" from family members or other "supporters."  If such evidence isn't produced, levy an annual property tax rate equal to one-third the value of the purchase. In other words, a rate that seriously discourages dumping of untaxed wealth. Purchasers who can prove that they have paid their fair share of taxes on their wealth receive a "normal" property tax rate. Everyone knows that foreign capital is wrecking housing and land affordability, and, as the article confirms, this money can continue to find ways into the market by proxy through "non-foreign" buyers. The solution is to link real estate purchases to income tax. Demand that fed., prov. and municipal gov. cooperate to make it happen.	0

2377	eng_test_2377	Actually, the Mayor of San Juan is a more experienced elected official and public servant than Donald J. Trump.   She held her first press conference on the afternoon of the hurricane after herself having accompanied City officials making preliminary assessments of the damage, and specifically addressed the total obliteration of the housing built along the Martin Pena Canal.   She is absolutely right in pointing out that the island is only 100 miles by 35 miles, and that by now, basic relief supplies (water, fuel, food) could and should have reached any point on the island by appropriately sized military helicopter.   She is showing better, smarter leadership than the thin skinned, sociopathic Trump.	0

2390	eng_test_2390	Ms. Adams, granted I am not a marine biologist, but I am a Ph.D. astrophysicist and I know my way around technical papers and how to contact the authors of those papers.  Have you read the referenced papers? I have and my statements are based on those readings.  As I keep writing, they are not applicable to the west-side beach because the geology is considerably different, and I confirmed this difference by contacting one of the authors.  They knew of no studies of beaches like the west-side beach.  As  for the trampled tidelands of the "rocky shore" variety studied in the papers, the studied trampling was much greater that what would be experienced at the west-side preserve.  Even then, one of the papers quoted nine months as a sufficient amount of time for the biological communities to recover.  Finally, the west-side beach is heavily affected by wave action during storms.  The resultant grinding of the upper tidelands is not condusive for macroscopic life - look at the beach.	0

The reason they don't want us to feed the birds is that if we do feed the birds then lots more birds will come, dropping poop all over the place and ruining the ambiance.  Same concept goes for providing free food, shelter, medical care, etc. -- we become a magnet that attracts illegal immigrants and homeless people.

2412	eng_test_2412	I dare say there is. Though it occurred in the 1800's, hundreds of thousands of Americans on all sides lost their lives in the American Civil War. One doesn't have to be a racist to understand that a complex grievance of that magnitude doesn't disappear overnight.  Americans are to be admired for their attempt to honour both sides in their civil war. Arguably, it's what kept their country together and fostered its ascendance to where it is today.  To survive and prosper as a country, you have to acknowledge your past. By no means should you condone any historical abuses- instead they should be front and center and a lesson for all.	0

I'm assuming that all this traveling is to many other places besides the mother's house. Of course the mother would need to know if they're traveling to see HER. And she'd know when they were leaving HER house. But OTHER travel trips?  Why doesn't this idiot LW2 simply STOP REVEALING HER TRAVEL PLANS TO HER MOTHER?

Then, would you be prepared to offer up some kind of 'voter stupidity' measure, whereby we evaluate voter stupidity on some kind of international scale in order to identify 'smart outcomes of an election' VS 'stupid outcomes caused by stupid voters'?  Such a measure might be useful to politicians hoping to win in spite of voter stupidity and it might encourage tactics encouraging the stupid voters to just never mind voting because their stupid voting just gets in the way of the smart outcome.  OR, we all get one vote, stupid or not.	1

At the last second they were advised to bring him back to base because he might be an intelligence asset. Then he was interrogated and tortured, which is also a war crime. Then he was incarcerated in a prison. Another war crime. Then he was put on trial. Which is a violation of the Geneva Conventions. Then he remained incarcerated long after hostilities had ceased. That's another violation.  You truly don't get it. The Americans- along with the Canadian government- grotesquely violated Khadr's rights as a child soldier/enemy combatant in multiple ways, including the use of torture. The only treatment worse than what he received would've been a battlefield execution. And it's only by the grace of God that didn't happen.	0

For the 46 years I've lived in the area these two community elements have be "co-existing"....bickering, fighting, hassling.....sure, like two kids sitting the the back seat on a long journey.

2600	eng_test_2600	Mr. Trump's values as an individual and a businessperson have always reflected his demonstrated belief that life is a "zero sum" game.....if something benefits You it is a detriment to Me.....and, conversely, if I'm to benefit, by definition, it will have a cost to You.  His every action as President reflects his applying this very set of values to the office:  to economic policy, to social and environmental policies, and to international relations.  As he promised in his campaign...it's all winners and losers.    Only 17% of Americans favor withdrawing from the Paris Pact, 61% favor continuing membership.  Mr. Trump was loyal to his narrow base of climate change deniers and chose to withdraw from the Pact.  This is yet another example that we have a President whose actions do not represent the desires of, or promote the welfare of all Americans and the rest of the world.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte joked Friday that soldiers could rape up to three women, as he reassured them of his full support under his newly imposed regional martial law.

What the hell was their motive?  I feel terrible for the men who were murdered.   Their family, in grief, can't call them hero's for dying at the hand of DRUG RUNNERS, because sanctimonious partisan agents, needed to score points on the Admin.   That's unpatriotic and totally lacking in compassion.    Hypocritical that the far right always says gun's aren't the problem it's the people holding them.

School boards would have 50% of their members elected by voters, and the rest appointed by the city/county and maybe another means would be to have parents of students or (children soon to enter school) elect people to serve on local parents boards.	0

We do have separation of Church and State in this country...thus, our laws are not supposed to be affected or influenced by religious institutions (I'll wait while you stop laughing).  Religious beliefs revolve around the idea of a Supreme Being or Supreme Beings or whatever...yes, there are "moral codes" and such, but the core of it is belief in an unseen higher power.  Political beliefs revolve around how we are supposed to act within a civilized society, how we are to treat our fellow citizens, how we choose to punish those who behave in what we have collectively deemed to be a criminal manner...and all of that is - ideally - meant to be accomplished separate of religious influences.

2812	eng_test_2812	You are so wrong. What you didn't learn about Alaskan Natives is that many of our ancestors DIED because of the invasion of western civilization. This is what the government didn't want to teach you in schools.

You are so ignorant, it's sad to see people not know anything about the real Alaskan Native History. Now we have people like you.	1

2815	eng_test_2815	This was an excellent opinion piece:  very clear, sensible, and full of detail.  I was not aware that so many residents spent such a high percentage of their income on housing.  Thank you for that information.  That unfortunate situation could get much worse in the future, as you suggest.  As more people migrate to Eugene and compete for the limited housing stock, housing prices and rents should increase unless the supply also increases to keep pace.  It seems pretty obvious that one solution is sprawl, but a much better solution is a vibrant, beautiful, walkable, more populated neighborhood that has a real pulse, character, and energy to it.  I bet millennials and Gen zers in Eugene would overwhelmingly agree, and they are the ones for whom we should be planning this City's future.	0
2816	eng_test_2816	It's basic human nature and economics that the rich, their bought-and-paid-for politicians and anyone making money off of the current state of affairs, will defend the status quo and try to protect their investments. That is the only reason that the Republicans and the one percenters care in any way about the environment, because they don't want their applecart upset.  Change the equation and let them be losing money because of global warming and they will soon be on the other side of the debate, screaming for a halt to the effects of the human race.

2825	eng_test_2825	Keep in mind that every manufacturer offers fairly economical 'base models' that almost no one buys.    When Musk introduced the Model 3 over a year ago, he said that the base model would be a great car, and it will be.  It will include all the important safety features enabled at no extra cost.  It will have the same Supercharging capability as the higher end models, and it will have over-the-air updates capability.  Additionally, it will come with all the hardware installed needed for full autonomy in the future, including very expensive computing hardware.  However,  like all model levels , when that hardware becomes fully operable through software updates and regulatory approvals, it will cost the owner to fully enable it  I agree that many people will choose to pay more for premium features.  However the base model will be well worth the base price of $35,000.	0

2846	eng_test_2846	Personally, when ACA was enacted I hoped for the best but prepared for the worst.   We ended up with a 52% increase in premiums and while attempting to work with the Exchange we did not viable options so we ended up paying an additional ~ $500 per month.  We were not fortunate enough to have medical coverage subsidized by the government as employee (those making these decisions) or a recipient of subsidy.  This "premium" is really  monitored by the IRS (it is a described as a "shared responsibility"... tax liability").  For those who opt not to pay this "tax" it will become a "tax liability".  So aside from us locally having to have the albatross around our neck with the under funded ERS (~$23,000 per private sector tax payer) and the impending burden of funding the ACA (which Aetha has opted out of several states).  The ACA needs to be tweaked or repealed to "reasonably accommodate" both Makers and Takers.	0

2853	eng_test_2853	Well the Mueller Investigation must extend beyond collusion, because there was no collusion.

In the meantime this court spent $8B of money without demonstrable outcomes beyond embarrassing itself. Thus it is mere window dressing presenting a false picture about effective international law.   Perhaps it is time to admit that international law is rather ethereal - not reaching much beyond specific ( trade ) contract enforcement. And our future will be built better if we were to actually focus on the future, what it should be - and not drive into it looking at our rear view mirrors.   Lastly given our extensive multiplicity of cultures, legal systems, power politics ...  it is naive to expect short term solutions. A more strategic aproach is called for - probably generational time frames.	0

For this year. Now, come next year, there will be 400 homless, VS 350 this year. Why? Because the word gets around. people will depend on the new housing. And, when you can spend ALL of whatever you get, and worry not about rent? So that, two years down the road, there will be another 100 homeless. Because? People will hitch hike to Vancouver. For a home. And, year after year, more and more will arrive. New units need to be built. And then even more. There is no end. So, the solution is first of all, and important, that housing is equally provided across the nation. This is a nation wide concern, after all. Perhaps? A never ending crisis.	0

As you've noted elsewhere, workplaces don't usually operate on the basis of "free speech."	0
2926	eng_test_2926	#3 This deceptively simple distinction unites our scientific approach to knowing with all other realms of knowing. Because the Data of Sense is shared data, the collaboration and confirmation through the duplication of science is possible. Because the Data of Consciousness is subjective, internal, and can only be shared second hand, all other field of endeavor, although equally human knowing, are less successful in producing a body of broadly shared and agreed and confirmed knowledge like science.  The second level of consciousness is entered when we ask What questions, Questions for Intelligence. That is, when we ask questions with a view to Understanding the Data (of sense or consciousness) that the first level has made us aware of. Most of what we are aware of when we study or explore novel issues on our own occur on this level. The thirst, the desire, the objective on the second level is Insights, flashes of understanding that generate Explanations answering What is the case?	0

2942	eng_test_2942	"ETFO supports the integrated model in which students with special needs are in the regular classroom."  One size does not fit all: we need a range of models and programs. Forty years ago almost every city had facilities for children and youth: training schools, detention (open and closed), residential and day programs, special education classes for high-needs students, etc. Most of these facilities have been closed for decades.  It would be wonderful if every kid could function well in the regular stream at their local school. The reality is that there are some children who, usually for a multitude of reasons, cannot or will not at that moment in time.   Meanwhile, teachers are told to keep their hands off students. Acting-out students are aware of this policy and feel empowered by it, knowing that any physical attempt to curtail violent behaviour will result in 'trouble' for the teacher via parents, CAS and Board administration. We need alternative programs that are effective.	0

I'd personally go to the US and find the best functional medicine person out there I could if I were in this little boy's parent's shoes.  I would test for B12, the nutrient that can destroy health so easily it's not funny if there's not enough.

3140	eng_test_3140	Being a Syrian I can testify that this report is based on baseless information only to torpedo the peace efforts that is about to take place and to stop Trump from coming closer to Russia. From the very beginning, the war in Syria was never a war for democracy or freedom. It was/is a war by proxy where terrorists are used under fake names and stories. The goal is to induce regime change and achieve political outcome that serves the West and Israel. All Western governments directly or indirectly are involved in this crime against Syria. The UN and other international organizations are mostly biased to what the West is saying. The so called Syrian rebels never wanted to challenge Assad in a fair and just election. That what their masters instructed them because they know from intelligence reports that Assad will win due to his  support by most Syrians. The fact that he endured all this pressure and outcries, is self evident that he is genuinely supported.	0

3163	eng_test_3163	Hywnsytl, a part of me agrees with you. You make sense. But the other part says Coach Rolo understands people and motivation. His message is clear to all the players -- "Work hard and good things follow." If he didn't reward work ethic, then a different message is clear -- "Doesn't matter how hard you work. Only the talented will be rewarded." This message is fine for the NFL where money talks. But this is college ball, and the players are students first. The coach's job is to make them believe they can grow if they work hard -- and if they work hard enough, they can win.  We've seen, time and again, coaches taking average players and motivating them to play beyond their individual capacity.  That's the definition of a great coach, and we're lucky to have had our share of really great ones -- in my time: Tomey, Wags, and June.  And now we have Rolo, and all the signs say he is destined for greatness, too.	0

Plus, all the racket kind of defeats the whole purpose of going for a walk in the woods.

3249	eng_test_3249	I agree, RadirD. The media needs to stop the coverage and let this embarrassment of a first family fester in their own slime. There's way too much Trump family follies and vulgarities in the news these days. Every day it's something stupid or ugly that they've done. Or something embarrassing to the country. The more Trump and his tribe are in the news, the more of a laughing stock the U.S. becomes around the world. It's sickening. Stop the coverage and let 'em rot. They'll be gone soon enough.

The new neighbors complained to another neighbor that our woodshed is "unsightly". The neighbor shared just to laugh over how stupid Lower 48 immigrants can be. We don't bother to paint the wood shed and there are a collection of old windows stored behind it that hubby is turning into a greenhouse this summer. Hardly the definition of junk yard, but that's what the new neighbors view it as.  Another neighbor has a project car and totaled car that he's cannibalizing for parts in his driveway. After three years he drove the project car away this weekend to have it painted. Will the wreck go away soon? He might need parts off it in the future, so is it any of my business?  Then there is the guy by my brother's place with a dozen old wrecks unmoved for decades. Seeking to fix him, I might end up painting a shed. BCWYWF	0

3279	eng_test_3279	That's contradicted by the facts. First of all, Democrats have acknowledged the past and the party evolved to the anti-racist side, which prompted southern racists who used to constitute the Solid South for the party to migrate to the GOP, where the South now pretty much votes solidly for Republicans due to the GOP's adoption of the racist polices the Democrats used to push. If there are any remaining racists in the Democratic Party, the members will marginalize and push them out.  The Democratic Party of the 1800s, though, was the conservative party. They were not "leftist" at all.  Entitlements are not "slavery." That's just a silly remark, pre-packaged propaganda to demonize people who need help. Look at Ben Carson -- on public assistance and loans and public housing all his life until he made it on his own, and now he demonizes welfare. Bunch of hypocrites.	1

Mohammad unified the Waring Tribes that were killing themselves, into Large Armies, his Armies were conquering "the Known World".  His large Armies had a Severe Logistics Problem, Mohammad then wrote the Holy Koran making it Law for All Nations to provide Food, Clothing, Support, Money to the Armies, and that All Must Join the Jihad without any excuses.  109 Suras of the 114 Suras of the Holy Koran are the Declared War Against Christians, Jews, Unbelievers.  The 5 Suras state that Peace will be achieved when all Christians, Jews, Unbelievers are Subjugated to Islam.  The Holy Celebration of Ramadan is the Muslim Celebration of the Defeats and Massacres of the Christians, Jews, Unbelievers.  Ramadan Fasting represents the Muslims getting up before dawn eating and drinking then going into Combat without food and water.  continued	1

In our social discourse, our entertainment, in a myriad of settings, so much so as to suggest that it is not the "big deal" that it may have been in days gone by, and certainly does not warrant the attention it is still getting here today.   Oh and, by the way, I think Chelsea did us all a favor by reflecting our discontent, and doing it in such a way as to make the vision stick, to rub our noses in it. Yes the DNC screwed Bernie from the get go.

3370	eng_test_3370	Perhaps I should have used the word "Speculation" rather than "Opinion".  I do understand what I read and the vast majority of these thought pieces are speculation.  You can have an opinion on what has happened or transpired, but few are skillful enough to predict events or consequences in the future.  Take foreign trade for instance.  Can anyone predict that bi-lateral trade deals not yet made will be better or worse than multi-lateral trade deals that were never consummated in the first  place, such as TPP?  The examples of speculative "thought" pieces are too numerous to mention, including how some individual will perform his or her duties in the future.  Journalistic integrity seems to be at an all time low.  If you want to see contrasting examples, just read the Investors Business Daily political section and compare it with the New York Times and Washington Post.	0

3379	eng_test_3379	L2g not sure what you are implying....that all Veteran's are severely mentally or physically disabled? The suggestion about the "undocumented worker model" was in response to the comment describing employed yet unhoused workers couch surfing and no access to apartment life. The "model" simply points out how even those that come illegally are able to find housing. The question is...why does the culture of homelessness in the US not promote and encourage this model for independence. The culture here in the states is a mix of work, sign flying, panhandling directly asking others for "spange", handouts of food and clothing, camping near where resources are available. The mini co-op model works but not heavily practiced by the homeless here in the US.	0

One just has to look at Trump's fundamental anti-war leaning to refute the notion of 'bad' (unless one believes that war is good). As far as mad goes, Trump might be blunt and unconventional but the real madness is the mass hysteria by the Trump haters. Those people have truly lost their minds.	1

I am guilty of wasting a fraction of my existence by actually reading that novel, I must admit. A time, though insignificant, I will never get back. As a kid,  behind the Iron Curtain, I read a very prohibited copy of 1984- a story that had a profound meaning to those of us trapped in the middle of the experiment which Orwell described so skillfully, but to find anything meaningful in the 21st century North America that would relate to the Atwood's story borders on paranoia.	0

I think that is a gross understatement and what they are doing is not simply "subverting American law" but rather using their religious and political power as a majority religion to directly inspire acts of terrorism as the MEANS by which they achieve their political goals.  Dean Lewis Dear was directly inspired by the rhetoric of evangelical and other "Christians" or is it Christians (I don't know and don't care) to attack the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado in 2015.  You claim that a small minority of people hate women which, if by this you mean people who consciously hate women, could be correct. My assertion is different. I assert that the Christian religion has stigmatized women as being inherently "sinful" and influences society in general to view women as persons requiring sadistic punishments.  They want American women to pay for Eve's sin. We reject this and them.	0

We can shorten it by 140mi if we get to use the idle 10" fuelgasline that runs between Deadhorse and PS4-Galbraith.  GASFLOW = CASHFLOW  If we get the tiniest bit of gas flowing our direction we can make it grow into a statewide SuperGrid gas and power transport network.  This little noodlepipe will make Andree McLeod jump for joy  ;-p  Dirty wet field-gas NGL's can be profitably shipped in a funky little HDPE pipe like this. A HDPE-flexpipe shipping unprocessed gas can be defined as a ASTM/API gas-gathering pipe if we use it to transfer the raw-condensate to Nenana for re-injection, like CINGSA.	0

If you silence speech which is 'hateful' you are against free speech. We need to protect speech which is 'nasty' not speech which is 'nice'.   As to your belief in the need for safety and protection as Franklin famously observed, "those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety." Who are you to be so patronising and condescending that you feel it right that people not be allowed to listen to someone you personally disagree with?   "If we could rely on the citizenry to be thoughtful judges of the quality and truth of the thoughts, Milo would not be dangerous. But, he is." And there we have the illiberal authoritarian revealed in all their glory.

3611	eng_test_3611	Agreed, & yet I also agree with Edmund Burke, who said "All that is necessary for evil men to triumph is for good men to do nothing." Drone killing is evil, since it is execution without trial, & it is cowardly, since it is often done from a comfortable chair, thousands of miles away from the murder scene. Drones kill lots of innocent bystanders too, & it is common for their operators to "double-tap" a strike. They fire a missile which kills their subject & anyone in his vicinity, even in the house next door, but also wounds lots of innocent bystanders. When the locals come running to see if they can help any survivors, the demonic drone operators fire again, killing rescuers & good samaritans. If that isn't evil to you then you are devoid of conscience. I also agree with Gandhi, who said "You may believe what you are doing is inconsequential, but it is exceedingly important that you do it." When our lives are over, do you believe we're held accountable for them? Do what you can.	0

3624	eng_test_3624	There has always been a nationalist strain in Quebec political society, one that favours sovereignty, and it's not going to go away any time soon.

It's not the majority voice but it is significant and many non-sovereigntists feel a measure of sympathy for it whether they actually embrace it or not.

3625	eng_test_3625	I've accepted the fact that the uneducated people in our country elected Donald Trump, based on a lack of knowledge about what he represents.

It's extremely pathetic that his rabid fanatics don't understand what that really means.  The Trumpster is never going to be a legitimate president; he's always going to be Russia's candidate for POTUS, a huge win for Putin, and Russia's intelligence community.  Besides all of that, it's become obvious to anyone of even modest intelligence, and a penchant for fact checking, that when The Trumpster's lips are moving there's little doubt he's lying.	1

Surplus power sold into the off-peak spot market almost always trades at a deep discount, regardless of source. One of the advantages of moving to electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids is that these will form a large but flexible demand in off-peak hours, and where every 5 to 6 kWh replaces 1 liter of gasoline that would otherwise have been burned.	0

3702	eng_test_3702	The extraordinary mess that is health care in the U.S. is the result of the rigid and irrational beliefs by a majority of politicians, or the beliefs or interests of those who finance their election campaigns, that the free market is the best way to deal with social problems, failing to understand that social problems are considerably more complex than running a business in markets where the ultimate or only goal is to make a profit.	0

Seems pretty clear he has the authority. If this law was unconstitutional, why didn't the judges say so? This law was not shot down or even addressed by the 9th Circuit. In fact, it was not mentioned even once in the 29-page opinion issued by the 9th Circuit. Oversight? Intentional omission? Who knows, but the Supreme Court will overturn their ruling accordingly on these grounds alone.	0

3723	eng_test_3723	I couldn't agree more with this article.  I've been teaching part time at one of the colleges in their engineering technology programs.  I have had classes where upwards of 20% of the students have some sort of special needs accommodations, anything from requiring extra time on tests to having a service dog for comfort at all times to having students be able to set their own due dates for assignments.  The number of students who are on anxiety medication is frightening!  I don't know what is going on but we are under specific orders to accommodate even the most rediculous requests or we risk the personal liability of being hauled before a kangaroo court at the Human Rights Commission and having to hire our own legal defence in that case.  How these people ever will be able to hold down a job is a mystery to me, but that question is also taboo at the college where the councilling department seems to now be running the show.	0

3727	eng_test_3727	Overweight was once associated with age.  Apart from the occasional "fat kid" on the school-ground (the one that was usually standing while others were running or skipping) overweight was something that afflicted adults, as they eat ate even more they did at age 15,  drank alcohol, "didn't have time" for "physical nut" stuff like exercise and finally, avoided it because "it hurt."  I know what the writer's getting at with physical exercise being "natural" with the young, but this kid was no athlete.  I sat. Was a reader and TV obsessive, (LOTS of screen time) but when you grow fast and continuously, you burn calories just standing still.  My life-changing secret? Walking to and from school (at least 20 min. each way) five days a week for 12 years. Air cadet parade square drill sure helped ("lift those arms!")  The foundation for a lifetime of fitness. At age 70 I still walk and hike.  This also helped: very few desserts (which mom made), no pizza, and pop and candy very occasionally.	0

3732	eng_test_3732	Well, the business community had their chance with the economy and failed - big. Then it took a community organizer/Harvard-educated lawyer/civil rights attorney/constitutional lawyer/3-term state senator/2-term president to fix it, find stability despite a non-cooperative senate/house, and produce 8 years of economic/job growth with unprecedented (in history) stock market returns.  Maybe give the high school teacher a chance? Pretty sure he's not doing it all himself, and Canada has a darn good track record of financial stability. We are in a select club of just 12 countries that have a AAA (S&P) credit rating after all.	0

3737	eng_test_3737	Physical Retailers need to learn from their virtual competitors and bring in better inventory management systems.  I do not understand why in most clothing stores if one store wants to check if another has an item in stock they need to pick up the phone and call.  If they are linked on a central POS system the numbers should be available in the system including colour and size (essential what you get online).  I get that shrinkage may cause the numbers to occasionally be out of wack but most large retails appear to have not updated their POS systems since Windows 95 came on the scene.  If they actually tracked the inventory then they could move it around to locations where specific sizes and colours are in demand instead of being stuck at the end of season.  It would also allow for better ordering in sizes.	0

3747	eng_test_3747	How pathetic of Kellie Leitch to compare her Roman Catholic identity to Muslims in Canada.

3748	eng_test_3748	Mr. Hill: The city can live within the current rail budget with a design change that includes conversion from steel wheels on steel rails (SWSR) to urban magnetic levitation (maglev) rail, a change that can deliver a full 20-mile alignment for the $6.8 billion in available funds. Ms. Graham: Those of us who propose maglev would be pleased to describe to Governor Ige how a maglev conversion can be accomplished. If you want more affordable housing, you should oppose ever-increasing spending on SWSR. TOD works just as well around a maglev station. By the way, those who will live in affordable housing near the rail alignment would be much happier with the much quieter maglev. Ms. Culvyhouse: I share your outrage and would be most pleased to vote for Jill Tokuda if she decides to run for a statewide office next year.	0

3750	eng_test_3750	I understand about 9000 members voted on Saturday so the speeches were probably not decisive but would have helped Scheer somewhat.  You are right IMO that Andrew gave a crackerjack speech on Friday especially in his attacks on The Clown Prince.  Probably Scheer will get even better sharpening his attacks on Trudeau  and this is vital to success in 2019 since the media will mostly continue to give Justin a free pass and since the popularity of the Liberal government is pretty much all Trudeau and his celebrity.  A flat economy in 2019, more moronic and embarrassing behaviour by Trudeau, a huge accumulated debt,  more broken promises and at least a modest revival of the NDP will make the Liberals vulnerable.  Assuming voters decide they want change and conclude the PM has failed to meet expectations, a strong campaign by Scheer will bring victory.  The opening Liberal spin that Scheer is a placeholder candidate until a 2020 Ambrose-MacKay race is simply ridiculous.	0
3751	eng_test_3751	Good post.  I also think "the media" bears much of the blame in the polarization.  Being just a little extreme, either right or left, increases viewership/readership and increases revenue via advertisement sales.  It also increases the demonization and alienation of the other "side", by the other "side", further increasing the divide.  for example,  Fox news is the most-watched newscast in the US, and it's not because all viewers lean right.  Many lefties love to watch Fox, so they can get in their daily dose of indignation and self-righteous serotonin burst.  I'm waiting and hoping for the first politician to come along that actually is a centrist.  In his policies, Trump is, unfortunately his darker side keeps taking front and centre.    This article is an excellent start to a much needed and much better conversation.	0

3760	eng_test_3760	Forget the racist crap, unlawful immigration knows no race. Any race here unlawfully needs to have deportation proceedings initiated per Title 8 of the U.S. Code section 1225(b)(2)(A) It reads: "“if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a [removal] proceeding under section 1229a of this title"  It doesn't say anything about race. And implying only a "certain" race is here unlawfully is racist in itself.	1

3763	eng_test_3763	Oh and your argument is idiotic. If a party of and for the rich couldn't win elections in America the GOP would not have had any presidents at all after Teddy Roosevelt - the last liberal republican president.  Yet they've won often in the century since. By having all the wealthy votes and convincing half the poor people that their problems are caused by other poor people rather than policies which unjustly favor the rich. The only difference was that Trump named those people. But the story was always the same. Do you think Reagan's 'welfare queen' was white? But Reagan and the Bushes spoke of 'welfare queens' and 'gang violence' and 'radical Islamic terrorism' . Trump just said 'Mexicans and Muslims'.  That's not a change. It means the exact same thing. It's what conservatives have always voted for. Remember we had a conservative party in South Africa too : the guys who left the National party because apartheid wasn't racist enough for them!	1

3779	eng_test_3779	Using term 'deadliest beach' is misleading and many people will interperet it as most dangerous beach. Article shows lack of statistical and mathematical knowledge. Article compares absolute #'s of drownings, not the percentages per visitor count per beach. Example: Poipu has many more swimming visitors per annum than Lumahai on the North Shore. Any lonely visitor to Lumahai has a good chance of ending up in a watery grave.... however, great numbers have had safe swimming experiences at Poipu unscathed. Finally, this is not a good topic for a sensational headline. Hopefully the writer doesn't endanger people's lives with the article... Here's a safer sensational headline "nobody ever drowned on a beach in hawaii" (people only drown in water)	0

Hello: According to international standars such an illegal referendum was a shame of a farse that disowned the silent majority that don´t want to separate from Spain. That isn´t Franco´s ... ! That is common sense that, twice in the last weeks, went out in mass, in an fantastic outpouring of support for an inclusive - not an exclusive, chi chi fanatical, victimist - Catalonia. Those are facts to deal with, and - in the forthcoming elections to be held in December - 63% of the Catalonians at least, are going to vote for integration with Spain, not for an exclusive chi chi club of victimism that held an illegal referendum.	0
3782	eng_test_3782	If the leases are initially long-term (i.e. one year) then month-to-month, they are following the law regarding renters. You can rent rooms out of your house all you want, just have to apply for a business license and pay the GET. As the article mentions, with a separate contract for medical care, again they are following the law. To close this "loophole" you would have to radically alter rental law and renter's rights within the state.	0

3786	eng_test_3786	Over all good article, but it missed a major point on why this is happening.  Most houses in Manoa get handed down, few go on the market.  Also since you can live in Manoa and seldom leave the valley, the elderly (my parents among them) can live independently in their houses later into their lives.    According to Oahu Re there are only 8 homes for sale right now in the entire valley and only 26 sold or in escrow all year. Compare this to Palolo (which is half the size of Manoa) which also has 8 homes on the market, but 51 homes either sold or in escrow this year.  Low inventory of course also drives up price, which means the people who can afford those homes that do go to market will be older.  There is, also, no place to build new houses.  I would expect Manoa to start getting younger in a decade or so as the homes built in the 60s start getting passed down to the next generation.	0

This is political panic, and Caldwell is allowing himself to be stampeded by his opponents.  He looks weak, indecisive, insincere, and untrustworthy. He should be asked the obvious question:  If you are re-elected, will you then propose to extend the GET surcharge to complete the project?  If not, how do you propose to "find the money" to complete the project? Djou should be asked the same questions.  He has only stated that he would veto any "new" taxes.  Would a further extension of the surcharge be a "new" tax to him, or an extension of an existing tax? Is it really so outlandish to even consider extending the GET, if that's what's needed to complete this project?	0

3825	eng_test_3825	I love the rationalizations trying to say that the CPC fundraisers were different because the cost of entry was lower (eg: when Nigel Wright hosted a private fundraiser at his home for an Ontario PC candidate or when Dykstra hosted lobbyists in the private booth of the Skydome Owner, or Baird, or Raitt, or the multiple events starring Duffy and Harper).  So in other words, the Liberals are the high priced call girls while the CPC were the less expensive street walkers?     Is THAT the difference?  Face it - "cash for access" is a sensationalist way to describe fundraising when a politician attends their own fundraiser.     It's been going on for as long as politicians needed money and there is nothing inherently wrong with it.    Further, eliminating it doesn't solve one damn thing.	0

3833	eng_test_3833	Government provides the funding for basic medical research.    Drug companies take promising  ideas, that is potentially profitable ones, from universities and hospitals and conduct clinical trials which if successful will allow their sale and afford them patent protection.  Those who fund the trials are those who stand to profit and choose who will conduct the trials.  Those who conduct the trials therefore have an incentive to produce favourable results.  In addition, drug companies are not required to publish the results of studies that are not favourable.   Companies spend far more money on marketing their products, of which conferences are part, than they do on research and development.  It's time that Health Canada cleaned up the system.	0

3842	eng_test_3842	What's interesting is that the federal government funding covers diagnostic tests under provincial health care.     It raises interesting questions about who is determining the thresholds for determining test result outside ranges.   The labs?  The federal govt?  The provinces?  Who?   The B12 serum test is covered under health care and yet the range is dramatically different from the ranges used in Northern Europe and Japan, where the incidence of Alzheimer Disease is much lower.   The fact that the lower threshold in Canada is 138 ng/mL versus 500 ng/mL in Japan (not to mention ranges in Northern European countries) should raise big questions.  Alzheimer is just one piece of the picture.   B12 deficiency can be misdiagnosed as a wide range of diseases.   It is the most complex vitamin, and it has effects in all of the major systems in the body.   Deficiency triggers problems depending on genetic SNPs (snips or anomalies).   Alzheimer is just one of a long list of conditions.	0

3876	eng_test_3876	OMB & BLM have pushed to eliminate the requirement for BLM to survey Native (State) lands prior to conveyance.  The cost would shift from the Feds to land owners. Congress mandated in ANCSA 13(a) that BLM survey the exterior boundaries of ANCSA lands and State lands so they receive Patent to surveyed land.  BLM regs & policy change, but only Congress can amend Federal law. Kornze said "If someone else wants to know how we can save $3 million a year and continue improving the quality of work we're doing, I'm all ears." Contracting State surveys to private firms instead of BLM doing the work in house will realize much of that cost savings. Private survey contractors and BLM surveyors use GPS for most of the surveying; cutting the cost of the work in half. But the final results, physical monuments in the ground at reasonable intervals and density has not changed.  Using BLM’s new DPPS the bulk of the corner markers and traditional record systems disappear.  We don't want "Virtual Survey"	0

3949	eng_test_3949	Minimum wage increases are far more insidious than than what has been posted here. For example, if Company A's costs are $1.00 to put a product on the market and they want 10% profit, cost of the item is $1.10. If the cost increases due to minimum wage to $1.10, the 10% profit now makes the item $1.21. That increase is, of course, passed on to the consumer. Now look what happens. The business' gross increases, which means they have to pay higher taxes at the end of the year. The minimum wage worker also has to pay higher taxes, and that increase outpaces the gains made by the minimum wage worker. The result? More tax money to the state and the worker falls even further behind. But wait, there's more. Many union wages are ties to minimum wage, meaning that their pay is based on a percentage added to minimum wage, i.e., their wages go up, forcing those companies to raise their prices. More tax dollars go to the state(and Fed.) But wait, there's more...	0

3960	eng_test_3960	Trump is a pathological liar who routinely lies about things big and small, regardless of reality because he knows his dim-witted followers will believe everything he says.   My opinion that Trump supporters are not just uninformed, but are actually stupid is based upon the following: When one is ignorant, that can be remedied by seeking out knowledge and retaining it. When one is stupid, one is not only proud of one's ignorance but actively refuses to become informed and scorns fact-based education.	1

3977	eng_test_3977	The US won the war in the Pacific. Micronesians suffered from invasions, occupations and subjugation. The US took responsibility for these Islands via the UN & TTPI. At termination of the TTPI, the US performed a study to identify how much money would be required to update infrastructure (hospitals, schools, roads, water, sewage, power, airports, to U.S. standards. The amount was staggering. Congress did not fund the COFA (Compact of Free Association) to that extent. Mellen is right. These states cannot be self-sufficient. They cannot raise capital and have little to export. Their natural resources can support  tourism, but that is not enough. The CNMI appears on track with hundreds of millions of hot money being invested for casinos and resorts. That outcome has been money laundering, human trafficking foreign birthing. Foreign vessel registrations and money laundering seems to work in the Marshalls. The US needs a presence in the Pacific, Congress has to fund it.	0

3988	eng_test_3988	I hear that more corps. are having trouble finding employees who test clean on marijuana such as CA techies. Some of the most creative are users. So corps had to lighten up. Unemployment rate is historically low, workers have more opportunity to shift. If an employer tests at the initial hiring, many do not test subsequently such as the post office, some stores, RG? (per the grapevine).   More may start their own businesses to avoid working for the man and his antiquated ways. Cannabis Culture could mean a sea shift in the very concept of work or right livelihood. Youth of today may want to enjoy life more, may not require family wage jobs C of C, BOC, CC  promote. Home ownership out of reach of many it seems.  Ive sometimes wondered if some home schoolers in the past or even today do so to avoid kids tattling on them to teachers. Were kids sometimes ripped away from families if marijuana was found in their homes?  I think I recall this chapter in the history of selective persecution.	0

3990	eng_test_3990	"Whether it is 1 per 100 or 2 per 100, each additional 100 'homeless' would increase the actual number of violent people coming in."  But the number of housed people is also increasing in Eugene, has been for a long time. Since some portion of them are obviously violent, judging by the news, that will also increase the number of violent people here. So we're back to the question of whether the homeless are proportionally more violent than the housed. I don't know if anyone has the numbers, but I don't think so, just based on those I've met and other information.	0

'When you are figuring out what that correct thing is - and listen very carefully here - remember that the impact of Canada's Charter violations are continuing to this day and, unless Khadr's circumstances change, will continue into the future.  Got it?"  They also added a statement that, to most people, indicated that a refusal to repatriate Khadr  NOW would further increase liability in the damages case.  The Harper government refused to bring him back for another 2 1/2 years.   ps, many of the British detainees had been held in Guantanamo about 1/5 the time Khadr spent.  Work it out.	0

No mention of councilor Clark, who I think would be for it as this is a business deal that would create jobs and spur growth. That seems a strange turn of events.  As it is now, the land does not provide much if any revenue. Besides the tax revenue the project could generate, we need people living downtown.  There is certainly a shortage of low-income housing. HACSA housing is of such high quality that few notice its presence. It seems to increase the value of the neighborhood because the property is maintained and the residents follow strict guidelines. Obie "Wan" Kenobi can benefit, especially since this will add customers to 5th Street Market. Some people just don't like a rich person making a profit, let alone with the help of a tax break. Seems weird to me since there is such reverence for tax breaks for the "job creators." Given what I know, I am slightly in favor of the project.	0

4155	eng_test_4155	Thank you for the links Truthbender. I will look at the Ottawa Forum stuff when I have some time. The thing that gets me about the first link is that Paris has a lot of ideas about how to reform our trade relations with our North American neighhbours. I'm not sure a customs union is the way to go, but it is an option, and it is what the EU has. So you would think by now he would be pretty peeved that Justin "Get the f--k out of my way" Trudeau hasn't taken any of his ideas on board. The full court press Trudeau talks about seems to be all about preserving the status quo. But Paris doesn't seem at all miffed about being ignored.  It seems odd that someone who obviously has a lot of ideas would show such dog-like loyalty to his not-so-great leader.	0

Even as we speak, Trump’s Administration is using private emails to conduct illegal “White House” business. Is the content confidential? The answer is undoubtedly yes, since most if not all of his involves colluding with Russia and covering up Trump’s and his administration’s crimes, past and present.

Net loss. Then you have 20% sponsored. These sponsors will cover assistance for 12 months and after that the contract is done and welfare can begin. Any rogue sponsored immigrant who leaves prior to that year can go on welfare but will have to be repaid by the sponsor as per high court ruling. The majority of these immigrants  will be on welfare and you can cite my source from previous posts that I'm sure are still unread. Once again a net loss. Then I'm assuming the last 20% you conveniently left out are simply unsponsored economic migrants which no doubt is a massive net loss.

In the past 5 years alone, the GTN pipeline you claim as a flawless example has had three incidents, totaling over $1.14 million in property damage and an value of ~$380k in product spilled: https://goo.gl/LgZ3ao  Using the highest industrial price of $5.62 per mill Btu during those five years, $380k = 67,616,000,000 Btu. There are ~102,000 Btu per 1 Ccf, and 1 Ccf is about 748 U.S. liquid gallons. That $380k was roughly 495,885,135 gallons of spilled product. Care yet?   The operator information there doesn't even include "all" incidents, as operators are only required (under 49 CFR 191)  to report incidents that involve death or serious injury, property damage of $50k or more, a gas loss of $50k or more, and/or an unestimated gas loss of 3 million Ccf or more.

4334	eng_test_4334	Obamacare was a stepping stone to socialized medicine, everyone knew that. But all the subsidies are difficult to take away in one fell swoop. Until people get better wages they're trapped by the cost of health care. Unless you want everyone in the ER you will need to subsidize low income and pre existing folks.  As Perot said, "when people have good paying jobs a lot of social problems go away". Thats true. The economy is picking up and wages are starting to rise. That will help. Separating the pre existing conditions folks out of the mainstream insurance market will bring down rates some.  But the Rand Pauls of the world seem to think you can just make it all free market in one fell swoop. Thats political suicide. , it will take time.

And the NDP is going to "clean up" campaign finance - because it's not as if the NDP is beholden to a powerful and self-serving US union that supports Trump's protectionism... oh well, housing sounds good and the short-sighted idealists in Vancouver have obviously fallen for it. Meanwhile Vancouver is paralyzed by constant gridlock thanks to Moonbeam's bike lanes. But Horgan is going to invest in "climate change" aka high taxes and McGuinty/Wynne-inspired social experiments that amount to an exercise in government incompetence under the guise of being "sustainable".

4441	eng_test_4441	Wrong, of course some people got insurance but no where near the numbers promised and 84 % of those were simply gifted into an already overburdened medicaid. And while they have the card new studies show the uninsured have better outcomes than those on medicaid as doctor flee from the regulations and stop accepting patients. While this was happening millions lost their coverage as insurers dropped out of markets and those seeking employment found only part time jobs that allowed employers to avoid providing costly insurance. More lost coverage when small business were forced out of business or had to downsize. The next time government publishes honest number will be the first time, they have proven themselves unreliable. All this is really a distraction from the fact that the end game for democrat's is a socialist 1 payer system which the majority do not want. As we've already seen socialist programs cost more, provide less and take away free choice. It's also unconstitutional .	0

If you've hit some bad luck, then social assistance should be available for a while to help you get back on your feet; but a lifetime of living off my earnings - I don't think so.

4457	eng_test_4457	I just endured listening to Carol Off on the CBC's As It Happens soft pitch our environment minister on the Paris treaty, insisting on contrasting the Liberals with the Harper government's take on agreement. Not once did she mention that the Liberals have essentially adopted the Conservatives climate change targets. As a reminder this means that the EU and US (until today) plan to reduce their emissions by about 2.8%/year between 2020-30. Canada will achieve 1.7%/year.  It was a typically tedious piece of biased and cloying journalism dressed up with the smug leading assumptions of Ms. Off's politics. I am no fan of the Cons approach to the issue but expect more than a partisan info-mercial from our taxpayer funded broadcaster. I would rather have heard more about the fact Paris sets no binding targets for reducing global GHG emissions and no timelines, deadlines or penalties for failure to comply. But I suppose that would have been an "inconvenient truth".	0

As a former COO, I can tell you that no company on this planet pays a $20 mil bonus if they're losing money.  You must think your readers are stupid or totally naive.

The UN is a joke, just look at Russia and the Sakhalins, Tibet, Crimea, the South China Sea but you pick on Israel for defending itself against aggressors. "We tried to destroy you but we lost, can we please have our land back?" Of course we can't talk about Jordan or how other Arab states treat Palestinians, it's all Israel's fault - you reek of unapologetic leftwing ignorance, you have no credibility and represent the outspoken leftwing fringe of useful idiots who turn a blind eye to Hamas terrorists and their Islamist supporters - pathetic.	1

Greenland figured it out nearly 50 years ago and moved all of the social services and subsidies into the cities.  Some people chose to continue their subsistence lifestyle.

He talked to me for about 5 minutes and it was just a nice way to start my work day.

4509	eng_test_4509	This incident and its reporting are leaving me with more questions than ansewrs. Unless I missed something, there is no mention of when the tests were run. It appears it was in Nome after the race, but how long after? This article states "high levels" of the drug were found (and high  is not defined). If so, was the drug administered just before the test (and after the race), or was it administered earlier in a very high dose to begin with? In the first case it would not have affected the dogs' performance, and in the second it would multiply the chance and severity of side effects (which don't seem to have appeared).  In any case I'm not sure Tramadol would be anyone's first choice for a "perfomance enhancing" drug, and drugs, KNOWING the dogs will be tested?	0
4510	eng_test_4510	I find it comical that the left wants to portray themselves as the beacons of truth and morality when they themselves and their parrots in the media gave Obama 8 years of free passes on a daily basis. Remember like a month ago when Obama banned Cuban refugees from settling here? Where were the protests and outrage. You're the pot calling the kettle black. The daily echo chamber of liberal hysteria is undermining any potentially legitimate dissent or questions about the White House's handling of anything. EVERYTHING has been made out to be an outrage since Jan 20 so the hysteria will make nothing an outrage even if it should be (not that I've seen anything at that level). Ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?! The establishment liberal press is screaming wolf from sun up to sun down and is undermining their own intentions since the public has zero faith in them save the liberals who are locked in their echo chamber	0

4515	eng_test_4515	As long as people are judging this young man in the court of public opinion, I feel I might chime in on how ignorant two of these post's PERSONAL views, on a complicated social issue threatening our society, really are. First of all there is a presumption of innocence in a court of law before any evidence is presented to the jury. I assume it's to limit the amount of innocent people punished for crimes they didn't commit. To state your opinion of guilt after seeing a few sentences in an article, shows how ignorant you are of the rule of law. What if the police had questioned the wrong drunken idiot? And secondly, if the poster who thinks that tougher laws and harsher penalties is going to stop people from taking mind and mood altering substances, then you are deluded. you should go back to sleep and keep dreaming of your squeaky clean sandbox world where everyone conforms to your idea of society.   people have been taking drugs for two thousand years and will continue to regardless.	1

Shit man, they didn't even have the balls to call her a bitch using their own name, they had to make Williamson do their dirty work for them.   In any case, Hobbs is an owner and founder of the company, which means, bitch or not (and really, aren't we all bitches when we complain about our bosses?), they can't take her business away from her.

In BC, you can make a left turn on a red light onto a one-way street independent of whether the street you are on is one-way or two-way (BC Motor Vehicle Act, 129(4)(b)).  If you think about it, you are not crossing a line of traffic doing this, since that traffic also has a red light.  You can argue it's a bad rule (what if you try to make a left turn at the same time as a car going in the opposite direction tries to make a right turn into the same lane).  But it is the law.	0

If we follow the ETOF logic to its rational conclusion, the name of any town, building, street or park named after a white politician from the days of Champlain to the present will have to be expunged and changed.  That does not leave any names of the white colonizers to use. What is to be done then? Perhaps we should introduce a system of numbering all the changed names with a code? Would than make ETOF happy?

The Prosecutor also refused to get local call information from BC Tel, even though BC Tel was collecting it routinely as part of their push for local measured call billing. Telcos have been using paper tape Automatic Message Accounting data to record every local call since the beginning of direct dialing, but instead of getting a Judge's Order to produce it the Crown speculated about whether local calls had been made (wire line phones in those days).  Sort of like the NDP deciding not to use the videotape of a logger assaulting an environmentalist, saying that their appointed prosecutor could not locate a VCR player and TV to use in the court, leaving it to the jury to decide between logger said / tree hugger said.

4594	eng_test_4594	Now that is a load of B.S., Gerald. Number one, there are not enough well-paying jobs to go around to offset the cost of living in Alaska, let alone bush Alaska. So, according to your premise, those in the bush should move into urban centers to "better" themselves and their prospects because they should "compete" with others in their aspirations? The economy will not support them, it already barely supports those who already live within the urban paradigm with its cheaper cost of living. So where do you propose to put them, those seeking higher incomes and failing that, besides prison, that entity that feeds you? The cost of living in the bush is already twice and three or four times as high as that of living in the "Big Village." Why the PFD should not be messed with and why a flat tax remains so unfair to those already paying much higher costs than you just for life's essentials. BTW, did you move to Alaska from somewhere else? You seem to have a profound misunderstanding of Alaska.	0
4595	eng_test_4595	And who do you see as setting the agenda in Juneau Steve? Who do you understand holds complete control of any legislation being debated in Committee let alone on the floor and then voted on? You know damn well that the GOP totally dominates the agenda and nothing can move without the caucus approving and no one in the caucus is allowed to disapprove. The lack of leadership belongs to those in control of the purse strings and that has been the Republicans for a long, long time now. Your false equivalency is a ploy to divert attention from the legislators in Juneau who were incapable of setting an agenda that dealt with their number one job which is balancing the budget. Nothing the Dems offered was considered in committee let alone allows to come to the floor for up or down votes. Nothing of significance happened because the GOP legislators would have to make uncomfortable and politically risky votes just as the Governor did when he submitted his balanced set of cuts/revenue increases.	0

4614	eng_test_4614	This is great! The article mentions the availability for new and expectant moms, and in one place, for grandparents (great to mention the importance of them as well). It's a common social oversight, but the article neglects fathers.  First, the programming and the people involved do say that this is for new parents (not just expectant moms) and babies, so it is the article text that is incomplete.  (The headline is great -- the first sentence is incomplete). In fact, some of the training videos are targeted toward father involvement. It is wonderful that the program would also support fathers, both in related births as well as adoptions, so it would be great if the article accurately reflected fathers in this program as well.

Nothing happened except BC laughing at the term.  And now, three months prior to an election, Christy finds a renewed vigour in once again addressing BC outside of her developer friends in Vancouver.  Total failure with one exception;  West Kelowna, the seat that Christy bought when she lost her Vancouver seat in the last election, has had over $3b tax dollars spent on highways, bridges, access roads, overpasses and transit systems in an attempt to buy her next seat.  Seriously, did she really need to spend $500m on a direct route bus transit system from West Kelowna to UBCO  which resulted in an increase of 30 passengers per day?  That works out to $16m per passenger; yes $16,000,000.00 per passenger.  In the past weeks, she has announced a further $500m on new overpasses and streetlights, if she is re-elected.	0

4633	eng_test_4633	"Progressive" is code for Communist as stated by Karl Marx:  "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need." This is what you advocate, no matter the rhetoric you use to try to confuse or sugar coat the idea. Progressivism is theft from the useful by the useless, nothing more.  The only acceptable option is a FAIR TAX, based on a flat percentage of income, same rate for all, no exemptions, no exceptions. NO WAY should success be penalized and sloth or incompetence rewarded. America is about equal opportunity, not equal outcome. If you chose no education and a crap paying job (like "community organizer" for example) you have no one but yourself to blame and your envy of and anger at others success is pathetic.  What an idiot. The last person we need to hear from after the last 8 years is another damn 'community organizer', because that approach has worked so well, right.	1

It was specifically authorized by President Obama according to his press secretary.  What other justification is there for killing an Afghani leader in negotiations with the Pakistani government to cease hostilities while he is driving through Pakistan after receiving medical attention in Iraq if it is not during a 'war'?    And the cruise missile attacks into Yemen to support the Saudis and the daily bombings in Iraq from Italy by our Air Force and from our aircraft carriers are also post-war atrocities.    No.  Tom, the wars are not over, just being conducted with different weapons and fewer deaths---at least of our people.  You are doing a Bill Clinton - trying to define a word so it meets your needs, not the reality recognized by non-believers.  "I did not have sexual relations with that woman!"

This would have given people notice easily that this was going to happen soon.  You know why they didn't? Because it gives people time to move their stuff off photobucket and to somewhere else. they wanted to catch folks off guard and hold their photos for ransom, so people who have used it for years and have hundreds of thousands of pictures on their sites, can't afford to NOT pay that 400 to keep them up.  But photobucket fucked up, because I'm sure many of the folks who were strong armed into paying, won't be on their greedy little site next year. If i were them, i'd spend whatever time i had for the rest of the year to make sure i have ALL my stuff off and onto a site that respects its users.   The price is RIDICULOUS.

I've tried every other trick Google found in a vast internet of hacks, nothing else helped.

There's no reason honey bees would be out in those open playing fields... However, yellow jackets live underground and often have their little homes in those open fields.  Additionally, this time of the year they are really unpleasant little fellows.  They're aggressive and their stings really hurt.    Other than massive pesticide spraying....which I hope the schools do NOT do, all you can do is a)don't go barefoot and b) avoid the little rascals as much as possible.  Let's leave the honey bees alone, they're having a tough enough time surviving as is.  regards, Gary Crum	0

4692	eng_test_4692	What a load of cods-wallop.  Those in the temperance movement, and make no mistake, that's exactly what MADD is - a temperance movement,  are fond of using scientifically unsound catch-phrases such as "Impairment Starts With The First Drink."  The author of this piece is cut from the same cloth.    Unless we have 0.00 as the only acceptable Blood Alcohol Content, then we must by definition, establish a BAC level beyond which one is considered impaired.  Which means in the converse, below that limit, one is not considered impaired.  It must be set at some level.    There is no basis upon which to justify a change to 0.05 from 0.08 as being that ideal limit.  This is completely a political decision, not borne of research, science or evidence.    Wasn't it Trudeau who pledged "evidence-based" decision making in his government?  What a hypocrite!	0
4693	eng_test_4693	Eisenhower warned against the military industrial complex; he might have done us a favour and added the 'industrial complex'. The latter represents the power and proclivity of industry to hijack and convert science to its own profitable ends. For a half century, the sugar industry, so-called scientists and unwitting medical practitioners perpetuated a hoax on the world. It convinced us that fat, not sugar, was the cause of heart disease. Millions cut dietary fat only to become fat, diabetic and prone to heart disease.   I have huge sympathy for victims of melanoma. And yet it is inevitable that after industry has pocketed billions exploiting an irrational fear of the sun, real scientists will pronounce the whole thing a scam. Indeed they have already done so by declaring that genetics (phenotype) and repeated sunburn - not normal, sensible exposure to sun - are the real risk factors. Demonization of the sun has created a generation of draculas whose health has suffered needlessly.	0

4705	eng_test_4705	"Close editing'?  You mean it's too much trouble to read what you wrote?  Or it costs too much money to read what you wrote?    Back when computers were two story buildings, (Late 1960s), when a professional, like an attorney or a reporter or an editor or someone else whose sole product was their own written words, one person would actually read aloud to the other person those actual written words (to include punctuation),  while both had hard copies of the document(s) in front of them.   This was to ensure accuracy.    It worked.  Typos, misspellings, omitted or incorrect punctuation; all that sort of thing were not acceptable to 'professionals'.  It was often referred to as 'attention to detail'.  It applied to CPA's and other 'professionals' as well.  A 'professional' did not put their signature on a document without verifying its accuracy.	0

It's never about the objects; it's always about what people do with the objects, whether they be plastic bags, styrofoam containers, drugs, knives, or guns.

4772	eng_test_4772	This author takes a very jaundiced view of Russia and in fact is simply repeating American propaganda. Certainly the Soviets enhanced their empire but it was with political entities that were adjacent to and contiguous with the main Russian landmass. The US went far a field with its empire encompassing territories separated by large bodies of water such as the Pacific Ocean in the case of Hawaii and the Caribbean in the cases of Puerto Rico and Trinidad, not to mention its control of Haiti and many other nations in the Southern hemisphere. The Soviet's biggest push occurred when a Georgian was at the helm, Stalin! As far as I am given to understand, it was Georgia which started its little mini war by attempting to invade South Ossetia in the middle of the night, not a blatant attempt by Russia to invade Georgia (to me this representation by the author proves his contempt for the truth and his complicity in disseminating US propaganda).

Her dress is not up as she said, The guys hand does not look to be on her butt. Plus third girl in photo says she saw nothing. Swift is smiling in the photo. If this photo is one of sexual assault why the hell is she smiling? The evidence in this case seems damned shabby. I think one spoiled  celebrity lied like hell about this so called assault, stupid jurors believed this idiot because she is a celebrity. The 'little guy" went down and this exaggerating spoiled bitch from hell won. Then she was seen in all the right places like Mariska Hargitays sexual assault fund onstage. Swift makes me sick.She owes Mueller an apology.She goes on to make millions while David Mueller cant get a job. I wish Swift would fall in a damned hole. I am sick of her and her stupid faces.	1

Maybe you should compare a jail escapee who didn't get caught for years and had since had a family for 10 years.  She was then caught but was a good citizen while she was out.  Does that matter?  Only thing that matters would be that she escaped and never finished serving her jail sentence.  Throw her back in jail with additional charges of escape.  That's fair!!!	1

Zoolander still won't answer the question in the House of Commons how many times he was required to meet with the Ethics Commissioner despite being asked 18 times  I'm sure there's tremendous honor and perfectly acceptable if a Liberal skirts the questions and keeps Canadians in the dark about our own PM's ethics breaches and illegal fundraisers.	0

Buying politicians like Harper to do foolish things like close the coast guard base at Kitsalano was entirely foolish and the anger and distrust of that action will stay with Vancouverites for a very long time.  Trudeau opened the base but clearly that's not enough.  Kenney's more of  same Harper short term thinking.  Notley's slow and steady should win the race, but as this author notes, Kenney smells political opportunity and he will tear Notley down rather than work with her to do anything smart on this file.

4865	eng_test_4865	If you read the extensive assessment of SF's efforts to address rampant homelessness, there, you'll see that they provide a rich array of services, like the Navigation Center and transitional housing, but all of that has not reduced homelessness there. Homeless folks use the services, including apartments and hotel rooms,  but continue to spend all of their time on the streets, with their chosen family/social world.    If the goal is to reduce homelessness I'm not sure that emulating SF is the way to go. If the goal is to reduce chronic health conditions and otherwise help the continuing homeless to be more comfortable go ahead with the Navigation Center.	0

Those very states that are more knowledgeable about their own needs. And when you speak of lax standards of education, you can certainly lay the USA's poor comparitive world results on the federal government full of it's Democraticly lead education system. It's horrible and the those "standards" that you seem to pleased with are in sore need of improvement. Many of the states hate the meddling of the federal government in the (failing) education of their students. Why do you think charter and private schools have experienced such tremendous growth?! But, you're a liberal Kool-Aid drinker who's only idea is that if it's Republican, it has to be bad. That's why you've been on the wrong team for so long.

They are all, in many ways, interconnected and plugged into a larger set of people who really have years of experience in running local campaigns in Hawaii, successfully. The exposure of the individuals listed - Imanaka, Min, Yadao, also starts to show the mechanisms that Ige plans to use in order to campaign against Hanabusa for the Primary. Ige ain't stupid, he knows that Hanabusa will bring the full might and power of the Dan Inouye campaign machine to bear in order to win the primary from Ige. So in turn, the machine that worked a win for Caldwell - which was just about as intense - has been negotiated and now working for the Governor.   Get ready, and get informed not only about the candidate on the ballot, but the people behind the candidate really making the moves.

4900	eng_test_4900	Is the Journalist here attacking Anonymous Sources? Dangerous!  The article mentioned, not one but twice, that the bank staff complaining to CBC are "unnamed".  Well yes they are and protecting sources in cases like this is a cornerstone of journalistic freedom. Is the journalist here attacking that practice and protection with the two references to the sources being unnamed? Would this journalist suggest that the staff not be free to speak to CBC confidentially about this practice? As it is, the staff already risk being traced to their emails at some point.  I find that mentioning that the staff are unnamed without saying that this is normal and to protect their confidentiality is deeply disturbing. I would have thought the journalist would cheer protection of sources in a case like this. Very dangerous to even subtly indicate that the sources should be named.	0

Manafort was also being strong-armed by someone with inside knowledge of under-the-table payments and a secret meeting between Donald Trump and a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician   With charges ranging from leading anti-NATO rallies that encouraged Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, to illegally funneling millions of overseas dollars into to US lobbying firms, to taking more than $12 million in under-the-table payments, Trump’s campaign manager Paul Manafort has brought an extra dimension to Trump’s collusion with Putin.	0

"He proposed a system to lower state income taxes because that would help working people and because the state, at the time, had more than enough oil money."  '"I don't claim to be a genius,'' he once said. ''I'm just an ordinary citizen with decent human instincts.''   ''It seems to me that the only moral justification for collecting taxes is that the government needs the money in order to be able to provide the services,'' he said in 1977. ''When the government has sufficient monies to provide the services without the taxation, then that moral justification disappears.''   'It's in the nature of politicians to use the people's money to buy the people's votes,'' he said. "That's as natural as politican breathing".  www.alaska.edu/files/uajourney/Freeman.pdf	0

5055	eng_test_5055	Valid point, bad data. The author is correct that labor force participation is as important to understanding the Trump phenomenon as the headline unemployment number, but his shocker figure - 32% of American men over 20 have left the labor market - is deeply misleading because it includes retirees and college students. Anyone with access to Google can look up the salient number, which is LFP for men 25-54, on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics website. For men 25-54, the LFP was 88.2% in 2014, which is  2 points down from 90.5% in 2004 and 3.5 points down from the 91.7 figure in 1994, during Clinton presidency. Those are real, if modest declines, and while I didn't check state-by-state figures, they're probably higher in the Rust Belt. But it's a long, long way from 68%, which is the number the author gives. This, Canadian readers, is why you should always, always be suspicious when you see figures from the American Enterprise Institute, which is a right wing propaganda machine.	0

5108	eng_test_5108	"biggest bullion-backed ETF"  Seems questionable at best. GLD makes the claim that it is completely supported by physical gold yet it denies your every day investors the right to exchange for any of their listed 'gold'. This alone means GLD shares are just paper by the day's end. Moreover, GLD's prospectus is loaded with weasel clauses that lets the trust get away without the promised gold backing. A good example of this is in the section of the prospectus that states GLD has no right to audit subcustodial gold possessions. I have never heard of any justifiable reason explaining why this audit loophole exists.  I remember there was a well documented visit by CNBC's Bob Pisani to GLD's gold vault. This visit was organized by GLD's management to prove the existence of GLD's gold but the gold bar held up by Mr. Pisani had the serial number ZJ6752 which did not appear on the most recent bar list at that time. It was later discovered that this "GLD" bar was actually owned by ETF Securities.	0

5127	eng_test_5127	Gary, There seems to be conflicting data. Here, http://www.vpc.org/investigating-the-gun-lobby/blood-money/, the writer contends that since 2005, the NRA has received between $19.3 and $60.2 million dollars from the firearms industry. (I don't know when the article was written, so can't extrapolate an annual range.) Also shown are donations from firearms industry entities that range as high as $9 million though it doesn't mention if a one time donation or spread out over several years. Here, https://www.quora.com/Where-does-funding-for-the-National-Rifle-Association-NRA-come-from, if the writer is accurate, it shows that the majority of the NRA's income is from membership dues and individual donations. The writer uses the year 2010, which according to the chart, is more or less an average year for the range shown with a total income of nearly $228 million. How does this compare with data you've seen? Would these donations, when compared to total income, constitute huge influence?	0

5160	eng_test_5160	(continuation)  There is nothing nefarious about these facts, and perhaps the best way to see that is by analogy with more traditional campaign activities.  Paying operatives to post on social media is analagous to buying campaign ads on TV, radio, and newspapers. For each campaign it is simply a matter of deciding on the most efficient way to spent their money.   The large army of VOTERS/supporter/fans/activists posting on their own time and dime are analagous to citizens discussion the election over the dinner table, at the water cooler, in restaurants, at public rallies, etc.  As for Google, as a retired computer programmer I can assure you that Google uses extremely complex algorithms to generate its results. And Madison Avenue has always been active in trying to draw hits to its clients websites, mostly by embedding "bait" for Google in those sites. Without doubt, both campaigns are doing the same thing. But, once again, it is IMPOSSIBLE to actually control Google, period.	0

5176	eng_test_5176	The author raises the valid point that there may be some method to the madness of King Trump. When his opponents are enjoying Alec Baldwin on SNL, they are spending less time fighting the substantial and dangerous changes to America. The easing of emission standards will increase the energy needs of the USA for a long time, since the inefficient vehicles that will result have long and increasing service lifes. Trump is committed to decreasing taxes for individuals and businesses, even though the USA has among the lowest levels of effective (not nominal) taxes in the industrialized world. Once tax cuts go into effect, they are tough to remove, even though many of the problems in the USA are the result of under-investment in services that are handled more efficiently elsewhere in the public sector. Healthcare is the prime example but infrastructure is also a mess and will be made worse by the terribly inefficient Trump plan to address it.	0

These outlays include policing, court and prison costs. Health care and social assistance programs add additional costs of $652 million.The average Washington household headed by a U.S. citizen bears an annual burden of about $970 to cover the costs of the state's illegal alien population.Illegal aliens pay relatively little in taxes because of their low earnings and work in the underground economy.

5195	eng_test_5195	There was no annexation of Crimea. The claim otherwise is more fake news, meant to hype people up into supporting a position that isn't grounded in reality, but stems from ulterior motives. Crimea's democratically-elected government organized a referendum to rejoin Russia (as they'd been trying to do for over 25 years). After the referendum was successful, Crimea's government applied for accession to Russia. Crimea was an unbound region at that time, not a part of Ukraine, as Ukraine had ceased to exist as a legal or constitutional entity when its constitution was rendered null and void in February 2014 - meaning, there were no Ukrainian laws, and no Ukrainian territory. The outcome of the Crimea referendum has been confirmed as authentic by over a half-dozen international pollsters, and Crimea has invited the UN to visit and witness the situation.

5205	eng_test_5205	A point about the Conservatives and policies. As the official Opposition their current role is to provide a counter to what the government does or proposes. The Opposition party two years before the election doesn't set forth policies that they intend to run on, for the simple reason is that governing party's have  been known to adopt those policies as their own. Governing parties will run on their past accomplishments, a rehash of previous promises and additional new ideas. The Opposition will attempt to capitalize on the failures of the government , while attempting to offer alternatives to the more despised parts of a governments agenda. Polls, policies and where the individual parties are going doesn't much matter at this point.When the election is six months out and closing is the time that things really start to matter.	0

5208	eng_test_5208	Congratulations to the Planning Commission for crafting a sensible and flexible solution to this new problem.  I hope the proposed ordinance is enacted.  Something to remember is that rural properties have a very different fire risk than urban ones  --  except where they are on some kind of collective water system, most rural buildings are protected only by their own wells, and will basically burn down if they catch fire.  There really is a safety concern with a giant rural building housing a dozen people that's only built to residential standards.  For comparison, Port Angeles requires new residential construction outside the 4-minute response zone to have sprinkler systems.  I thought about the Dzogchen Ltd "B&B" when I watched a special about the White House last week.

When it gets you is a person who becomes an expert at out sourcing work to sub contractors out of the company just so they don't need to employ the minimum wage employees.  a CEO with the liability of 10,000 employees easily deserves to be earning near 7 figures.  which would only be earning $100 per employee per year.	0

I had a couple of professors warn me that the manner in which I present my ideas/findings would often not be taken well. While I have often paid that price, I still managed to succeed in life (so far). Maybe this small explanation will help in our future exchanges on this subject.  What I recall in my readings of Waldo (though honestly I couldn't remember his name) was that he came from NC as a slave and remained with Lane until the end of either his life or Lane's. It was always rumored that he was a slave but there was no smoking gun proof as far as I know. Waldo very well could have remained with Lane by choice, which is a very disconcerting notion for many folks. The Wikipedia entry mentioned by the article was removed (possible conspiracy?) because I read it and it was sourced.  When I went to look for it earlier today, it was gone.	0

5248	eng_test_5248	Here is one angle that is not mentioned in the article or by commenters.   You buy a house, pour all your money into paying it down.  Something happens, you lose your job, there is a big real estate crash, whatever.  You can't pay your mortgage and the value of your home is falling or has fallen.  (We don't all live in the GTA or the GVRD)  Upon bankruptcy, your home, car or most other assets can be siezed.  Except funds that have been in a RRSP for more than 12 months. Those are locked in and safe from creditors.   This may be worst case scenario, but diversifying your assets can protect you from events you cannot predict or may have no control over.   I vote to invest the money instead.  If you cannot afford the house with rising interest rates, you cannot afford the house.	0

"Personal liberty and human dignity" would presumably include Negro slaves and Indians, neither of whom were understood to be within the protections of the Bill of Rights until after the Civil War and the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments, for slaves, and much later than that for most Indians, who were not unambiguously considered full American citizens until the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924.  Even for native-born whites, the rights in the first ten amendments were held by the U.S. Supreme Court not to apply to the individual states (which, for example, might have enacted laws contrary to them, with the court's blessing--although most of the states did provide similar guarantees in their own constitutions).  Beginning in 1925, the Court began, selectively, to apply the Bill of Rights piecemeal to the states through the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment.	0

5265	eng_test_5265	You really do have a reading comprehension problem. The republicans took control of the house in Jan. 1995. The first surplus was in 1998, the three years following that year, 1999, 2000 and 2001 were surplus years. The huge tax increase that Clinton and a democratic congress passed was in 1993 and the deficit for FY 1993 was 255 billion, which decreased to 203 billion in FY 1994. That tax increase, among other things, created the huge win for republicans and allowing republican control of the house for the first time in 40 years. Republicans took control in Jan. 1995, impacting the FY 1995 numbers and the deficit for that FY was 164 billion, FY 1996 deficit was 107.5 billion, FY 1997 deficit was 22 billion and the last year prior to the next 4 years being surplus years.

5279	eng_test_5279	Thanks not how property taxes work. Property taxes pay for municipal services. Toronto I more dense and therefore has a greater municipal service/infrastructure utilisation rate, ergo property taxes can be equivalently lower.  Highways are a provincial mandate. Why should toronto be the only municipality to pay for the highways within its borders using property taxes? Why does mississauga not pay for 401 and qew within its borders? Why should Torontonians subsidise highways in other munixipalities throigh provincial taxes yet not receive the same?   And FYI Toronto is a net contributor to Ontario and Canada via income, sales and corporate taxes, no one subsidises Toronto's needs. Even transit is 80% out of farebox (high compared to other systems).  Municipalities should get more gas tax AND be able to toll. Tolling is also about reducing congestion and making those that do drive time more efficient.   If other municipalities need transit, they should build it like Toronto has.	0

The candidate, Scott Eickholt appears to have had very serious charges against him stemming from a DUI incident in 2006.  Eickholt was charged not only with driving impaired, but evading, and resisting arrest.  All three charges were class A misdemeanors.  Also of keen interest is the allegation that Eickholt has a federal record.    The News-Miner editor is refusing to share any of the criminal stuff with the News-Miner readers. The News Miner is also refusing to share that Eickholt has been sued numerous times because he does not appear to honor his commitments to repay loans.

It follows that through our public education, domestic taxation and income redistribution public policies, Canada needs to limit & reverse domestic widening of these disparities.  On the other hand, erecting significant trade barriers only retards domestic economic development & itself would be counterproductive to narrowing domestic disparities.

In 2014, before the oil-price downturn, oil generated a $70-billion trade surplus, far outstripping any other export category, and virtually covered large, chronic deficits in autos and auto parts (minus-$15.9-billion), machinery & equipment (minus-$21.5-billion) and electronics (minus-$34.3-billion).  Even at the bottom of the oil-price correction in 2016, crude remains the largest positive contributor to Canada’s merchandise trade, contributing more than $30-billion annualized in net export revenue as of August - Nope , no need for those pipelines at all	0

An attentive and informed reader (as you seem to be) will be intuitively aware of that, and take any statistics with an appropriate number of grains of salt. Huff, however, was not addressing how to read stats-based information so much as how to present it scrupulously, that is, in such a way as to avoid manipulating readers' perceptions.  The only way in which Huff's book has become dated is that readers were probably generally more attentive in the 1950s than they are today. His book still has value in that at the very least it will help calibrate your BS detector -- an all-too-valuable tool in today's political climate.	0

I read the book years ago.....written from a more new age or emerging church view,  the book is good entertainment and does involve the reader emotionally.  But it can be threatening if taken as a theological treatise...there are rules and Absolute Truth, despite what Mr. Young writes. The message that in spite of evil, God loves us and is with us is well-appreciated and faith based.  Mr. Young's presentation of Trinity I recall was very good - three distinct persons yet ONE God.    I remember at the time dissecting the book in a Diocesan group discussion - one of the resources used was this: https://www.osv.com/OSVNewsweekly/Story/TabId/2672/ArtMID/13567/ArticleID/10399/What%E2%80%99s-in-The-Shack.aspx  I think the insistence on referring to God as "She" or anything else is rather silly and merely politically correct.

Orbital patterns suggest a slight cooling pattern, if anything. Sunspot related solar cycles don't come even close. It keeps coming down to some sort of atmospheric perturbation... of which the most obvious is human emissions.   That's where the "denial" comes in. The counter argument seems to be that since it's not irrefutable, it is probably wrong. It's not, and discarding the body of evidence because it's not irrefutable, is essentially, "denial".

It has the same carrot and stick approach as Obamacare to encourage healthy people to pay for insurance.   This is what governance is... and it isn't easy. Will everyone that complained about having to pay for expensive insurance while healthy under Obama suddenly think it is a good thing under Trump?

5397	eng_test_5397	Seeking a weekend break from his campaign rallies, Donald Trump jetted to his yacht, which was docked off the coast of Italy. He invited Pope Francis and the press corps on board for a Saturday afternoon cruise. It was a rather windy day. The Pope's little hat, his zucchetto, was blown from his head and into the water. A crewman began lowering a boat to retrieve the zucchetto. Trump told the crewman not to bother. Trump climbed down the yacht's ladder; walked across the waves, picked up the zucchetto; walked back to the yacht and handed it to the Pope. The Pope and the press corps were amazed! Donald Trump could actually walk on water! Speculation immediately began as to how ABC, CNN, NBC, The Washington Post and New York Times would report this miraculous event to the rest of the world. The next morning the New York Times headline read . . . . Donald Trump Can't Swim	0

5399	eng_test_5399	Let's just look at the tax increases from Socialist Notley. 1. Top marginal personal provincial rate from 10% to 15%. A 50% increase! 2. Corporate provincial tax rate from 10% to 12%. A 20% increase! 3. Income taxes on dividends from 19% to 31%. A 63% increase! (provincial and federal) 4. Carbon tax implemented. This is one good political move she did make by calling a quasi sales tax a carbon tax. I strongly disagree with the tax however, no matter what it is called. Irrespective of who did what, prior to Socialist Notley, with the tax grabs above, you would think that we would be saving money again and having surpluses. With a "projected" deficit of $71,000,000,000 Billion by the next election. The actual will probably be closer to $85,000,000,000 Billion. I sincerely hope that we as Albertans have learned what the cost of socialism and NDP truly is. It has cost us lost businesses, human talent and the financial flexibility to grow our province.	0

5440	eng_test_5440	The professor spreads one of Canada's enduring myths when he claims:   "And above all, its immigration policy is tolerant and open-minded, making for the truly multicultural polity that provokes the world’s envy."  Wrong.  The fact that our "immigration policy is tolerant and open-minded" has NOTHING to do with Canada's success in assembling a PEACEFUL mix of diverse peoples. Canada's success in assembling a peaceful, low-crime mix DOES have to do with its immigration policy, but not in the way that the professor pretends.  Canada is peaceful because, unlike many countries, Canada for decades has had a powerful filter in its immigration machinery. And that filter is there to ensure we mostly receive very intelligent, well educated families, where the daddy and/or mommy from overseas is a doctor, a scientist, a pharmacist, an engineer.  Much about intelligence is genetic, and kids of smart parents tend to address problems without violence. That is the REAL reason why we have peace.	0

Foreign capital used to monoplize housing in Canada should not be allowed.  What was going on in the GTA housing market was a market failure; something had to be done.  Now, what is a reasonable price for a house in 2017? Would a 4 - 6% year-over-year price increase be considered reasonable? If that is the case, if one pays about 80% over the 2005 sale prices or about 60% over 2007, that should be ok. Paying for a property that has increased in value much more than those percentage increases would be too much and bound to fall either in the short-term or plateau in the long term.  https://twitter.com/MukHomam/status/851805647297548288	0

5519	eng_test_5519	One solution of labor cost avoidance of large businesses is for the State legislature to adopt a "Public Assistance Service Surcharge" (PASS) Recovery Tax.  Businesses would avoid this PASS Recovery Tax in two ways,  1. pay a living wage that raises employees above the threshold for Public Assistance eligibility; and / or 2. provide employees a 40 hour full time position at a living wage.  If a businesses chooses to do neither, the PASS Recovery Tax on the business would be the aggregate gross amount of Public Assistance benefits for the business's employee(s) paid by the government (taxpayers), plus a 3% interest charge on the gross amount.  Or, if the business chooses to pay a living wage and sufficient hours for its employees, and thus not eligible for Public Assistance, then the business would receive (as is the cost deduction is anyway) a 100% cost of business deduction for labor costs, plus a 5% tax credit applied to business's tax debt.

They've also mentioned development in Toronto has yet to brush up against these green-belts - which means we have more land to develop.   Given the fact only the real-estate industry has spoken about the supply side of things, it made me curious to find out more about the Frontier Centre for Public Policy. Their website says it "neither seeks nor accepts any government funding whatsoever. Instead, we seek to diversify our funding base as much as possible to ensure that we are not beholden to any particular industry, interest or persons."   This statement isn't enough. To be taken more seriously,  the Centre needs to provide more details on where they get their funding from.

Catching the rail will require this commuter to ride a feeder bus from Wahiawa to the Waipahu rail station.  Probably 25-30 minutes.  Then catch a 40 minute train to downtown or Middle street.

Now people with cash (certainly anything over $100,000) are withdrawing their funds drying up capital, eventually HC will not be able to cover the withdrawals hence the need for a loan (at >20%). If their GIC's, which also pay a very good rate (2.25% 2 yr) take a hit it is toast.  It is essentially a panic attack from the Bank customers wanting their cash back.

If you care so much about women who wear the niqab/burka being able to freely move/interact/communicate in open society, why don't you acknowledge that the VERY act of covering a woman's face removes them from society.  Facial expression, the moving of the mouth, looking at one's face when speaking to someone is INTEGRAL to basic human communication.  How can women move freely in the world when they are covered?   YOU ARE LITERALLY ERASING A WOMAN'S ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE.   This infantile belief of moral and cultural relativism is going to continue to polarize Canada.

5648	eng_test_5648	Here's some help.  First, it's interesting that you didn't recognize that my use of "in the most charitable way" was love!!  Please learn the distinctions between three sets of 'strengths'  1. Fruits of the Holy Spirit (love, joy, patience, kindness) 2. Human or cardinal virtues: prudence, justice, temperance, & fortitude. 3.Theological virtues:  Faith, Hope, and Charity.  Fruits..are given to us by God by our union with Him.  Human virtues are acquirable through practice.  Theological virtues are 'infused' in us.  We can't make our own.  We need to ask God for more of each.   Our desire for closer union with God through the infusion of those virtues.  Each gives us closer union in a different way.   Have you ever read St Thomas Aquinas's work on the virtues?  He profoundly related and linked the "virtue work" of the Greeks with the theological virtues.  He showed how the human virtues at their most perfect state dispose us to full use of the Theological virtues.   A complementary fit.	0

I don't know if she's guilty or not, but she shared information with me totally out of context and there was nothing in the conversations that I recall about the accelerant theory being wrong.

5673	eng_test_5673	I'm not a big fan of either, but I've seen both, if you can count the first three Star Wars movies and a random smattering of different Star Trek episodes as having seen them.   Of course you have an apples and oranges problem in making the comparison, because the scope of the two projects – objectives, budgets, people involved, and all things creative – were so different. Trek was conceived to sell ads on network TV, right? Wars was a Lucas/Spielburg extravaganza. Sure, Trek became a series of movies too, but that was afterthought. So it bothers me that you cite history based on the movies with Star Wars first, when Star Trek actually started almost two decades earlier than Star Wars, in 1966, as a television show.   Production values, star power, effects, of course all go to Star Wars, and there is budget and objectives behind that. But Star Trek did start earlier, paved the way, and had a long history of different people involved, with an interesting flair for putting real human problems (racism, for example, a recurring theme in Star Trek as the different races dealt with each other) into a new perspective. And there's interesting comparisons on the big picture, too ... the great Yoda perspective and quotes, of course, and the whole power of the force, in Star Wars. But Trek embraced big picture too, like the larger collective metaphor of Seven of Nine.   I wish you'd done a straight compare and contrast, instead of which is better. Better will always be subjective, and it's too close ended, in my opinion.	0

5683	eng_test_5683	The Emmerson Reeve made the best case as to what should happen with the current influx of refugee claimants crossing into Canada, that they check in at a border crossing. The current system of just walk across and we will pick you, is hardly a sign of a government that has such high aspirations, and then behaves like a third world country. Goodale is a little bit disingenuous when he says that crossing this way is not a free ticket to Canada , as border services outlines who gets to stay and who doesn't and very few are  transported out of Canada. Related to this are the thousands of people who have been slated to be deported from Canada, but can't be found. Again Border services are very forthcoming with this information. The Liberals apparently prefer to just let the whole thing stay as it is, and hope no one notices.	0

If you can get the 20% down ($50,000) the current 30 year mortgage would be around $950/month or $11,400/year.   Of course your property taxes in Eugene on that sort of house are likely to run around $3700/year or $308/month so the taxes might tip the balance between what's affordable and what isn't.	0

Yet you still complain that everything I've already posted is just a lot of "werds" to you.

5729	eng_test_5729	Amazing it took so long to prove the obvious. There are night owls and early birds, and having a schedule that matches your natural rhythm is better for everyone. This is even more pronounced in adolescence.  I am a boomer, not a millennial, but was always a night owl...until my mid-fifties when suddenly my sleep pattern changed and I turned into an early bird, who knows why.   The world is still designed on the pattern of pre-modern, agricultural life, when you had to get up early to feed the animals, etc., and "the early bird gets the worm", and so those lucky enough to be born early risers had the advantage over the night owls. That is no longer necessary. I was so much happier when I got a job with a schedule that fit my natural pattern, after decades of trying to adapt to the "normal" schedule.	0

5734	eng_test_5734	Comments from a former setnetter and long time dipnetter. First, run timing varies tremendously day-to-day, even tide-to-tide. The fish school up in the rips, then push into the river in pulses. No one knows why they wait, or why they all come at once, but it is glorious if you're there during a big push.  Secondly, saying that "optimal" dipnetting requires 80K to 120K is akin to saying A+ is optimal for GPA. The huge days produce quick limits, but that there are only a handful each year. Counts over 30K are generally sufficient to get your fish if you are competent and persistent, and success increases incrementally as 30K is exceeded.    Third, commercial openings do not necessarily preclude success. This year, 30K was exceeded every day from July 10 to July 18, despite commercial openings on July 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18. Between pulses, there are fewer fish for everyone.   Finally, it's a shared resource, and weekend dippers would benefit from no EOs on Saturdays.	0

But you don't seriously believe that dogs have killed all the ground squirrels, rabbits and ptarmigan near Anchorage do you? First of all, there never have been rabbits in the Chugach foothills. Those are snowshoe hares, which have huge natural population fluctuations. Ptarmigan also cycle naturally. Ground squirrels have never been abundant in the front range, in my experience, and of course they hibernate for 6 months a year. All three species are still there.  You do realize that many dogs nowadays aren't much bigger than a cat? And most cats I know can back down a dog. Do you see lots of stray dogs in Anchorage? I don't, probably because most people obey the leash law, at least when they are around other people and pets. And Anchorage Animal Control actually picks up roaming dogs and at least some owners are fined. Anchorage doesn't even have a person assigned to pick up cats.	0

Free speech is a two way street.

We both came to the conclusion we were adult enough to handle him and any potential flirting he might do, seeing as it was a group situation, in public.  But, alcohol being what it is, she flirted back with him and intentionally pitted us against each other, and then he got possessive.

A lot of athletes, because of the time they spend on the practice field and playing games, will select easier courses of study so they can better balance sports and academics.

So no, I don't think even political legitimacy is certain, but I'm not sure if there is a mechanism in American government to address this.  Yes, very left progressives looked to Russia, especially in the '30s, but many became disenchanted.

That being said... The CRA might appear to go after the poor because they hit the low-hanging fruit which usually is the that segment of the population who can least afford an accountant or who try to do everything themselves.  Of course having worked in the CRA when there was a Liberal government in power (who were going to rip up the GST... twice) and a Conservative government in power I can tell you that nothing changes, and no directives re: who to collect from, makes it down to the collectors, their managers or team leaders.

Having a State senate with no Republicans is an embarrassment and a huge failure on the GOP party leadership.  The GOP's plan should be: 1. Get Republicans in office. 2. Once you have clout due to increased party size, then you can start pushing the party platform.  If you don't get to step 1.  You will never get to step 2.

Trump or any other President's first responsibility is to ensure the safety of American citizens. The NK threat to the US  is fast approaching critical and a pre-emptive attack on NK could occur if Kim carries out his latest plan to fire missiles close to the US base at Guam (the US military may well construe it as an actual attack and react accordingly with the blessing of their Commander-in-Chief).

The very big companies are rarely involved in phase 3 - and in fact tend to actively oppose and undermine it with some pretty egregious anti-competitive behaviour. When they realize they can't stop it happening -they either die off or, in very rare cases, join the revolution (think IBM's PC which killed the original Apple by doing the exact same thing cheaper with commodity parts).  In extremely rare (one in a million) cases -a phase 2 company is led by somebody who knows phase 3 must come, and tries to position the company to be part of it when it happens.

As a former police officer I have seen and read of far to many sad cases of what happens when someone puts their own gun into play without the proper skills to know what to do with it after it has been brought into play (i.e. the perp gets that gun and uses against you or some other innocent person).  If you are not prepared for the eventuality of taking another's life, for God's sake leave that gun at home in a lockbox!

Kerran saat tappelussa iskeä tauluun ja sen pitää riittää, kun se tippuu, matsi päättyy siihen kun se kaveri ottaa lukua.  Se on nyrkkinujakoissa ihan kahden miehen välinen kunniajuttu, että tippunut/sammunut jätetään rauhaan ja munille ei potkita.  Nytkö SUN mielestä poliisi saa mennä lyömään virkamerkin suojalla sitä tajutonta humalaista? Näinkö on asiallista SUN mielestäs toimia? Saatanan sairas poliisinpalvoja nilkki!

Kyllä siinä pisti miettimään että tällaisia(ko) meissä aikuisissakin oikeesti on. Hitto miten tyhmää. Olin oikeesti niin lähellä suojatietä enkä voinut millän käsittää että sieltä vaan vauhdilla käännytään eteen (kai mulla on sitte niin hiljainen auto?) Jälkeenpäin saa todeta että onneksi olin valppaana ja osasin varautua. Mitä jos olisin vaikkapa näppäillyt radiota sillä hetkellä?  Itse koitan niin ennakoivasti ajella ettei edes tarvis pysähtyä vaan hiljennän niin kaukaa että toinen ehtii tien yli mennä. Näin mulle on opetettu autokoulussa.  Sanon vielä sen että käyttäkää järkeä niissä suojatien ylityksissä vaikka kuinka olisi oikeus itsellä mennä ensin. Miettikää onko järkeä hyökätä suojatielle kun rekka on tulossa (60tonnia) Onko sulla oikeesti niin kiire että tuollainen massa pitää pysäyttää just sun takia.

Jos mies ei halua viettää joulua perheensä kanssa, eikö hänen ihan itse aikuisena ihmisenä pitäisi hoitaa asiat siten, että saisi viettää nautinnollisen ja haluamansa joulun. Ja toivottavasti et vastaa, ettet häntä omaksesi edes halua. En nimittäin sitä edes tarkoita. Miehen - ja naisten - pitäisi tehdä omat ratkaisunsa eikä roikkua löysässä hirressä, kun eivät parempaankaan pysty.  Jos olet miesystävällesi Ihminen, pyydä häntä tekemään elämässään ratkaisut siltä pohjalta, että kerranhan täällä vain eletään.

6144	fin_test_144	Uskonto on sairaus  ...ja sellaisena sitä tulisi hoitaa. Toiset ovat pahempia kuin toiset, mutta yhtä kaikki, imevät ihmisten verta niin kauan kuin ihmisessä vähänkään on annettavaa ja sitten jättävät kuolemaan. Näillä on ihan nimikin - loinen.  Olen koittanut ymmärtää uskovaisia, ovathan ne päällepäin kilttejä ja "hengellisiä". Miten sellaisiin voisi suhtautua negatiivisesti? Mutta, nyt loppui kärsivällisyys. Tämä järjettömyys on mennyt riittävän pitkälle.  Uskonnot eivät ole mitään muuta kuin massojen hallintaan tarkoitettu väline jonka ainoa päämäärä on opettaa ihmisille etteivät he ole itse vastuussa elämästään, että orjana heidän elämänsä on jonkun arvoista. Tottele raamattua, tottele pappia, tottele poliitikkoja, tottele rahaa, kas olet muka onnellisempi. On valmis kirja mitä seurata, kuinka sopivaa. Ei tarvitse itse miettiä mitään, kun lukaisee opuksen, ja kas; elämä onkin selvä. Jeesus / Allah / joku hihhuli / Joulupukki sen kaiken tietää, eikä minun tarvitse mitään muuta tehdä, kuin ottaa hyvä asento ja totella.  Oikeasti nämä ihmiset ovat päästä sekaisin, ihan tosissaan. Mormoonit sentään avoimesti keksivät niin uskomattoman typerän tekstin että varmistivat ettei siihen kukaan täysipäinen usko, näin saatiin porukkaan vain kaikista typerimmät idiootit ja kas, homma toimii kuin junan vessa. Mutta, nämä kristityt hihhulit, voi elämä, että osaa olla vajaa päistä porukkaa. 2000 vuotta ovat kupanneet ihmiskuntaa parhaimpansa mukaan, eikä Islamilaiset ole sen parempia.  Ajattelin aiemmin että, kyllähän näitä hihhuleja sietää. Mikäs siinä kun ovat hihhuleita niin ovat, jokainen saa olla millainen haluaa. Näin ajattelin. Ja ajattelin kyllä vieläkin, mutta mitä minä en voi sietää enää sekuntiakaan on organisoitu, pappisvetoinen järjestäytynyt uskonto. Se on täsmälleen sama asia kuin natsismi. Ainoa, mikä erottaa natsin ja uskovaisen on tapa millä toimivat, mutta maali on täsmälleen sama. Kaikkien on uskottava siihen mitä pomo sanoo, oli se oikein tai oli se väärin, mutta pomo juttelee jumalan kanssa, niin tottahan toki hänen on oltava oikeassa. Kuinka tyhmä ihmisen pitää olla jotta uskoo tuohon sontaan? Kaikista parhaiten tämä näkyy siinä kuinka nämä "uskonnot" suhtautuvat itsenäisesti ajatteleviin ihmisiin: saatanasta, perkeleestä ja pirusta ne ajatukset tulevat. Ajatteleminen on syntiä. That's it. Näitähän sitten saa kivitellä ja syrjiä kuin parhaaksi kukin hihhuli katsoo.  Se miksi kirjoitan tätäkin vuodatusta nyt on että olen kyllästynyt tähän järjettömyyteen ja poliittisesti korrektiin "hienovaraisuuteen" niiden ääliöiden osalta joilla edes sen verran leikkaa ettei usko hihhuleiden pyhiin teksteihin. Halutaanko me tästä maasta sellainen että jokaisen eri hihhulin uskoa pitäisi kunnioittaa? Minkä ihmeen takia meidän pitäisi niitä kunnioittaa? MIKSI? Jos joku uskoo että maapallo on litteä, niin ei kai sen puheita oteta vakavasti. Mutta, annas olla, kun samanlainen sekopää kertoo kuinka jumala juttelee hänelle, niin hän on tietysti oikeassa vähintään siinä asiassa, että jutteleeko se omnipotentti valopää hänelle. Tämä poliittinen korrektius johtaa siihen että kun maailma yhdistyy koko ajan enemmän ja rajat katoavat niin mitähän te veikkaatte mitenkä käy uskontojen kanssa ellei kohta asiaan aleta puuttua? Ja mitenhän tulee käymään meidän rauhallisille ja maallisille uskonnoille? Tämä on sellainen asia mitä pitäisi luterilaisen kirkonkin ruveta miettimään ihan tosissaan, mikäli sille kelpaa olemassa olo. Jos ihmiset haluavat että jokainen sekopää saa uskoa mihin haluaa, niin uskonnoille on asetettava tiukat rajat. Ei sen takia ettenkö anna muiden tehdä niin kuin tykkää vaan, sen takia, että jossain vaiheessa joku uskonto tulee ottamaan vallan ja kas, yhtäkkiä kaikkien pitää siihen uskoa. Kylmä totuus on vain sellainen, että jokainen uskonto/lahko haluaa lisää ihmisiä eikä tule lopettamaan ennen kuin on käännyttänyt koko pallon. Vaikka jonkun uskonnon maailman valtaus yritys jäisikin puolitiehen, ei se poista sitä etteikö nämä jaksaisi kiljua itselleen erivapauksia. Pitää saada kivittää raiskattuja naisia, pitää saada silpoa lapsia, pitää saada sekoittaa lasten päätä helvetillä ja ties millä perkeleillä. Pitää saada moniavioisuus, pitää saada vaikka kuu taivaalta jos joku kaheli niin päättää. Vingutaan jatkuvasti tunnustusta ja arvostusta kun ansaitsevat korkeintaan halveksuntaa.  Verotusoikeus pois ja lahjoituksille verot. Uskontojen "suosiminen" kouluista pois, ja opettava osana historiaa ja/tai yhteiskunta tieteitä. Alaikäisten ihmisten kastamisen ja kirkkoon liittäminen on kiellettävä. Aikuisena saavat tehdä mitä tykkäävät, mutta ennen sitä yhteiskunnan on suojeltava heitä. Kaikki järjetön silpominen (ympärileikkaukset jne.) ilman lääkärin suositusta terveydellisin syin on kiellettävä. Kirkon toimintaa on verotettava rankimman mukaan. Aivan samalla tavalla kuin alkoholia ja tupakkaa.  Toki uskonnoissa on hyvätkin puolensa, lähinnä niistä irtoava musta huumori. Esimerkiksi nämä hihhulit kysyvät, että mistä moraali tai eettiset säännöt tulevat jos ei mihinkään usko? Samalla sanovat että jos eivät uskoisi jumalaan, niin juoksisivat ympäriinsä kännissä tappaen ja raiskaten ihmisiä. Tällaisella älykkyydellä varustettua ihmistä, tulee ihan oikeasti varoa, uskoi tai ei. Toinen "hauska" asia on sanoa ateismia uskonnoksi. Missä kohtaa ateismi on uskonto? En kyllä edes ymmärrä minkä takia tämä on uskonto & uskomukset kategorian alle, kun ateismi nimenomaan tarkoittaa sitä ettei usko mihinkään hihhuliin. Se on negaatio sanasta usko, vastakohta. Se ei ole sama asia, mitenkään. Jos valinta olisi joulupukin ja jeesuksen välillä niin sitten voisi sanoa että ero on uskossa, mutta ateisti ei usko.  Yksi vätys porukka on agnostikot. Pelataan molemmilla pöydillä kun ei uskalleta ottaa kantaa ja luottaa omaan päähänsä. Vähän uskotaan, ettei suututeta yläkerran herraa ja vähän ei uskota ettei kaverit katso kieroon. Sanonko suoraan? Sanon. Olette hanurista koko sakki. Mielinkielin kaikkiin suuntiin kun ei uskalleta ottaa kantaa.  Uskontoja ei saa kunnioittaa. Se on ensimmäinen ja viimeinen virhe. Jos niitä kunnioittaa ne tulevat kyllä ja vaativat aina ja aina enempi ja enempi. Hyväksikäyttävät typeriä ihmisiä ja heidän turvallisuuden tunteen tarvetta. Mihin maailma on menossa jos ei suitsita uskontoja? Eipä kamalasti tarvitse katsella maailman menoa niin saa hyvän kuvan maanpäällisestä helvetistä. Tätäkö me halutaan tänne myös? Lopettakaa se hienovaraisuus. Me ei kaivata tähän maahan uskontojen terrorismia. Hyvänä esimerkkinä nämä allah pilapiirrokset. Välittömästi pääministeriä myöten maa polvillaan. Missä on selkäranka? Missä on sananvapauden puolustaminen? MISSÄ?  Nimenomaan tätä se uskonto on. Ehkei meidän luterilainen hillitty uskonto ole näyttänyt pahinta karvaa, mutta älkää unohtako että ihan samaa kauraa se on, eri lautasella. Uskonnot terrorisoivat kansaa, miksi? Siksi että mitä surkeampi on ihmisten tila, sitä enemmän ne saavat seuraajia. Hyvin yksinkertaista. Kun ihmisellä on tarpeeksi hätä, tunnustaahan se vaikka Peukaloisen jumalakseen jos sillä saa ruokaa / turvaa. Onko se oikein? EI OLE.  0	0

6161	fin_test_161	Kuinka tälläistä sallitaan maailmassa  Tulipas taas oikein kunnon dokumentti noista palestiinalaisista itsemurhapommittajista. Tänään 12,7-06. Miten on mahdollista,että jotkut voivat olla noin perkeleen yksinkertaisia "ihmisiä" kuin muslimit? Ei mene jakeluun ainakaan minulle. Jauhavat tuota iänikuista paskamantraa paratiisista ja neitsyistä. Tuntuu käsittämättömältä ,että noin uskonnon kyllästämiä ja elämästä tietämättömiä "ihmisiä" voi olla olemassa. Herää kysymys: Mikä planeetta tämä oikein on? Tuollaiset puoliapinat ovat todella vaarallisia sivistyneelle ihmiskunnalle. Ne pitäisi eristää kokonaan muusta maailmasta. Ihan siis vankimielisairaalan tyyliin, pehmeään koppiin lopuksi iäksi. Tämähän ei tietenkään ole mahdollista. Mutta ne voisi jättää oman onnensa nojaan, tuet poikki, diplomaattisuhteet poikki, matkustuskielto kumpaankin suuntaan, kauppasaarto yms,,niin ne tappaisivat toisensa ennenpitkää. Islamin usko tulisi myös kieltää terroristisena ja väkivaltaa ihannoivana ja levittävänä idalismina. Kuinka on mahdollista, että joidenkin "uskonto" pohjautuu pahaan, tappamiseen, kurkkujen leikkaamiseen, itsensä ja muiden räjäyttelyyn. Ja sitten sellainen vielä hyväksytään monikulttuurisuuden nimissä. Tuossakin ohjelmassa pienet lapset hokivat fraaseja kurkun leikkaamisesta vääräuskoisilta ja toinen , vielä vauva, heilutteli asetta ja laittoi pyssynpiipun suuhunsa. Siis natsijärjestöt ovat täydellisiä pyhäkouluja noiden rinnalla mutta ovat silti kiellettyjä ja tuomittavia. Mutta tuollaista eläimellistä käytöstä sallitaan uskonnon ja erillaisen kulttuurin varjolla.	0

6258	fin_test_258	Fundamentalismista  Fundamentalismi on harhakuvitelmaa, jonka mukaan Jumala odottaa ja edellyttää ihmiseltä Kristus-uskon lisäksi uskoa tuhansia vuosia vanhan 1200-sivuisen kirjoitusten kokoelman absoluuttiseen erehtymättömyyteen ja ristiriidattomuuteen. Fundamentalismi on toisin sanoen näkemys ja vakaumus, että usko Kristukseen ei yksin riitä. Fundamentalismi on malliesimerkki opista, josta Paavali kirjoittaa: "Jos joku julistaa teille evankeliumia, joka on vastoin sitä, minkä olette saaneet, hän olkoon kirottu." Edellä sanottuun fundamentalisti toteaa: "Ethän sinä tietäisi Kristuksesta ja Paavalin evankeliumista mitään, jollei sinulla olisi Raamattua." Ja jättää lisäämättä: "Siksi sinun on uskottava KAIKKEEN MUUHUNKIN, mitä Raamattuun on kirjoitettu." Tämä on vasta-argumenttina niin kiero/typerä, että sille on hankala löytää vertailukohtaa. Mutta yritetään. Fundamentalisti on kuin mies, joka inttää: "Luit Kimi Räikkösen maailmanmestaruudesta Helsingin Sanomista. Sinulla ei ole mitään oikeutta uskoa Kimi Räikkösen maailmanmestaruuteen, jollet usko Helsingin Sanomien ja sen edeltäjän Päivälehden absoluuttiseen erehtymättömyyteen ja ristiriidattomuuteen vuodesta 1889 lähtien." Ikään kuin Kimi Räikkösen Ferrarilla vuonna 2007 Brasiliassa voittama maailmanmestaruus olisi jotenkin riippuvainen siitä, kuinka tarkasti ja oikeaan osuvasti kymmenet ja sadat toimittajat ovat asetelleet sanojaan helsinkiläisen sanomalehden toimituksessa esimerkiksi vuosina 1897, 1913, 1929 ja 1963. Vuoden 2007 uutinen Kimi Räikkösen maailmanmestaruudesta on toisin sanoen pelkkää huuhaata, jos joku Hesarin toimittaja teki vuonna 1927 virheen raportoidessaan eduskuntavaaleista. Toinen, vielä idioottimaisempi argumentti kuuluu: "Raamattu julistaa itse olevansa Jumalan Sanaa." Kyseinen virke on monipuolisimmin mieletön lausuma, jonka ihminen on suustaan/näppikseltään päästänyt. Se on sekä valhe että kehäpäätelmä. Ja tällaisten idioottimaisuuksien fundamentalistit kuvittelevat olevan olennainen osa evankeliumia. Ja sitten toki ihmetellään, kun kaiken maailman räsäsiä ja puolimatkoja pidetään hieman tärähtäneinä.	0

6272	fin_test_272	Ruusun päivä  Tänään 4.5 on Ruusun päivä. Siispä ojennamme ruusun Ruusuille ja ruusuisillemme. Tänään vietetään myös kirjan ja ruusun päivää. Mistä moinen perinne on saanut alkunsa? Vilkaisu Wikipediaan,vapaaseen tietosanakirjaan, niin asia selviää.  Ruusutietoa Kirjan ja ruusun päivän perinne Kirjan ja ruusun päivän perinne, jossa mies lahjoittaa naiselle punaisen ruusun ja nainen lahjoittaa kirjan miehelle, juontaa juurensa keskiaikaiseen taruun Katalonian suojeluspyhimyksestä Pyhästä Yrjöstä. Ritari Pyhä Yrjö surmasi legendan mukaan lohikäärmeen, joka oli aikeissa ahmaista kitaansa kauniin prinsessan. Surmatun lohikäärmeen verestä versoi tulipunaisia ruusuja täynnä oleva ruusupensas, josta sankari poimi kauneimman kukan prinsessalle. Pyhä Yrjö julistettiin keskiajalla Katalonian suojeluspyhimykseksi ja huhtikuun 23:nnesta tuli pyhimyksen juhlapäivä. Pyhän Yrjön päivää on juhlittu laajasti Kataloniassa ja muualla Euroopassa keskiajalta lähtien. Mutta mikä liittää ruusut ja kirjat yhteen? Legenda lohikäärmeestä ja ruususta on ollut yksi innoittaja, mutta tapa yhdistää kukat ja kirjat voidaan jäljittää myös keskiaikaan. Kataloniassa kukat olivat palkintona Jocs Florals -kirjallisuuskilpai- luissa, jota vietettiin Pyhän Yrjön päivänä. Nykyisin vietettävän Kirjan ja ruusun päivän alkuperä on vuodessa 1926, jolloin huhtikuun 23. valittiin barcelonalaisen kirjakauppiaan idean mukaan kirjojen ja ruusujen päiväksi. Myös päivän kirjallinen historia oli yhtenä innoittajana: 23.4.1616 kaksi maailmankirjallisuuden klassikkokirjailijaa, Miguel Cervantes de Saavedra sekä William Shakespeare, kuoli. Huhtikuun 23. on myös Halldór Kiljan Laxnessin ja Vladimir Nabokovin syntymäpäivä. 1995 Unesco julisti katalonialaisen Kirjan ja ruusun päivän Maailman kirjan ja tekijänoikeuden päiväksi. "Kirjat ansaitsevat erityisen päivänsä, jolloin niitä juhlitaan vapauden, yhteenkuuluvuuden ja rauhan symboleina", sen julistus kuului. Kirjan ja ruusun päivää ja Maailman kirjan päivää ei kaikkialla juhlita juuri huhtikuussa, vaan monet maat ovat sovittaneet päivän itselleen sopivaan ajankohtaan. Esimerkiksi Iso-Britanniassa ja Irlannissa tapahtumaa vietettiin tänä vuonna 2. maaliskuuta. Vaikka päivää vietetään eri maissa eri aikoina, kannatetaan kaikkialla päivän alkuperäistä ideaa ja Unescon periaatteita.	0

Puolustus on vähintään yhtä naurettava kuin puolustelijakin. Rikosten tekeminen ei ole ollut eikä ole kenenkään velvollisuus.

Mielestäni kyseiset punaloiset eivät ole anarkisteja nähneetkään. Jos on anarkisti, asettautuu koko nykyisen järjestelmän ulkopuolelle eikä toimi sen keskuudessa millään muotoa. Nykyiset "anarkistit" haisevat kotonaan paskalta ja nostavat työmarkkinatukea ja sossurahoja yrittäen samalla esittää kovaakin kapinoitsijaa. Ei ne muutamat punkkikeikat teistä anarkisteja tee, eikä huumeiden veto tai kaljan jatkuva kiskominen. Todellisuudessa olette yhteiskunnasta riippuvaisia orjia jotka kuuluvat sen alimpaan kastiin.

6446	fin_test_446	>  Tässä tunnustat, että olen oikeassa: hiilihydraatti ei ole sama asia kuin sokeri. Miksi ihmeessä sitten vielä kiellät tämän faktan ?  >  Niin sitä helposti "kyllästyy" kun tulee eteen tilanne, jossa on vaan pakko tunnustaa olevansa väärässä. Tee se nyt, niin päästään eteenpäin.  >  Vitut, kirjoitit hiilihydraatit = sokeri. Älä yritä perääntyä väitteistäsi, ääliö.  Nyt sitten lue oikein helvetillisen tarkasti tämän keskustelun aloitus. Siinä lukee mm. nämä faktat: japanilaiset eivät kärsineet lihavuudesta eikä sen liitännäissairauksista kun heidän ruokavalionsa koostui erittäin suurelta osin hiilihydraatista (jopa 67 E-%). Vasta myöhemmin kun heidän hiilihydraattikuormansa on vähentynyt ja rasvakuorma lisääntynyt, niin heidän diabetesluvut ovat alkaneet nousta. Miksei 67 E-% hiilihydraattia syövät ihmiset ole lihavia vaikka hiilihydraatti mielestäsi lihottaa ? Aivan, väittämäsi on täyttä hihhulipaskaa. Hiilihydraatit eivät lihota. Ainoastaan ylimääräiset syödyt kalorit lihottaa.  >  Jos rasvaa ei syö yli kulutuksensa. Jos taas syö yli kulutuksensa, niin on aivan sama, mitä se ylitse menevä osuus on, rasvaa, proteiinia, hiilihydraattia tai alkoholia, niin ihminen lihoaa.  Ei se rasva, katsos vajakki, mihinkään toiseen ulottuvuuteen katoa, jos syöt sitä liikaa. Se jää vyötärölle.  >  Ilmeisesti siis myös Wikipedian kirjoittajatkin ovat torvia: "In general, the monosaccharides and disaccharides, which are smaller (lower molecular weight) carbohydrates, are commonly referred to as sugars". Mene ihmeessä korjaamaan, jos "tiedät", että hiilihydraatti on sama asia kuin sokeri. Todellakin: mono- ja disakkaridit nimetään sokereiksi, mutta polysakkaridit saavat rakenteensa funktiona nimet selluloosa, tärkkelys jne.  Sokeri [Wikipedia: "Sokerit ovat hiilihydraatteja, joiden molekyylit koostuvat yhdestä (monosakkaridit) tai kahdesta (disakkaridit) sokeriyksiköstä".] todellakin on juuri sitä (usein) makealta maistuvaa tavaraa. Siitä käytetään nimitystä sokeri. Muista hiilihydraateista käytetään nimitystä tärkkelys, selluloosa jne. Ne ovat eri asioita - juuri kuten sanoitkin: niillä on eri GI. Jep, siksi ne eivät ole sama asia kuin lyhytketjuiset (tai monomeeriset) sokerit.  >  Se muodostuu sokerista, mutta ei ole lyhytketjuista (tai monomeerista). Talon runko muodostuu puusta, mutta talon runko ei ole sama asia kuin puu (todennäköisesti olet sen verran syvällä tuossa idiotismissasi, ettet pysty tajuamaan näinkin selkeää eroa asioiden välillä, hiilihydraatti muodostuu sokerista, mutta esim. selluloosa ei ole sama asia kuin sokeri - sillä on rakenteellinen funktio, joka erottaa sen "rakennuskappaleistaan": rakennuksen runko ei ole puu vaikka rakennuksen runko muodostuu puusta).	0

6505	fin_test_505	Urpilaisen metsärosvot  Urpilainen viittasi demarijohdon olevan metsärosvoja (Robin Hood & co). Niinhän ne melkein onkin. Oppositiota voi verrata metsään jossa nämä metsärosvot piileskelivät. Tekivät sieltä iskuja järjestäytynyttä yhteiskuntaa vastaan samalla tavoin kuin demarijohto nyt heittelee ruikutuksiaan oppositiosta. Mitään järkeä ei ruikutuksessa tarvi olla niin kuin ei yleensäkään kun demari on esittäjänä. Demarilla vaatimustason pitää aina olla matalampi niin kuin virkoihin ja suojatyöpaikkoihinkin. Nehän vois muuten jäädä työttömäksi tai ilman koulutuspaikkaa.  Pitäisi vain muistaa Urpilaisen ensin ottaa asioista selvää, ennen kuin vertaa itseänsä metsärosvoihin. Robin Hood ja muut metsärosvot kyllä varastivat rikkailta, mutta eivät he köyhillekään sitä jakaneet. Lainasivat pirunmoista korkoa vastaan niin kuin koronkiskurit yleensäkin.  Mutta hei. Sehän sopii hyvin kuvaan sillä demarithan polkee pienituloisia, köyhiä ja työttömiä jalkoihinsa niin kuin ei mitään. Mutta ei haittaa. Joku tyhmä näistäkin voi taas ensi vaaleissa erehtyä antamaan äänensä tälle rosvoporukalle.	0

6516	fin_test_516	Vaikuttaisi siltä että kyseessä saattaa olla autoimmuunisairaus. Meillä oli ihan samantyyppistä vaikeutta, aina räjähti milloin mikäkin paikka tulehdukseen, ja koira allergisoitui nopeasti ruoka-aineille joita se ensin vaikutti sietävän. Ihosta lähetettiin koepalat patologian laitokselle, josta tuli vastauksena vaikea atopia. Autoimmuunisairauteen eläinlääkäri valmisti koiran omasta verestä seerumilääkkeen, jota sitten pantiin poskipussiin sellaisiin pieniin pampuloihin imeytettynä.  Kehottaisin sinua nyt vaihtamaan eläinlääkäriä, (hakemaan toisia näkokulmia) mikäli nykyinen neuvoo sinua vain pelkästään turvautumaan ruokien vaihteluun ja kirjoittelee antibiootteja. Koiran tilanne vaikuttaa niin hankalalta ja tuskaiselta että alkusyyt pitäisi saada selville, siellä nimittäin voi olla joku tämäntyyppinen juttu taustalla joka aiheuttaa sen että vastustuskykyä ei ole käytännössä ollenkaan, tai että koira sen nopeasti menettää altistuttuaan ärsykkeelle (tässä tapauksessa ruoka-aineille). Onnea matkaan!	0

Asioista on hyvä puhua suoraan poliittisesti korrektissa maailmassa.  Seksi ei ole normaali asia. Se kuuluu parisuhteeseen. Mitä enemmän naisella ollut kumppaneita sen suurempi taakka miehelle kunnioittaa naista. Niin se vaan menee, vai miksi naiset häpeävät seksikumppaniensa lukumäärää jos se kerran on ihan normaalia kuin hampaiden pesu?	0

6533	fin_test_533	Seuraavassa puutun niihin, mitkä palstan näkökulmasta ovat relevantteja.  ”I NUMERO 1: RASISTEJA ON VAIN PIENI OSA KANSASTA.  Väärin. Rasisteja on 100%, sillä jokainen ihminen tekee havaintoja eri etnisten ryhmien kollektiivisista ominaisuuksista. Mikäli esim. mustat eivät olisi lainkaan erilaisia, miksi sitten hyysäri saarnaa monikulttuurisuudesta?”  *Mover*: Ei rasismia ole erilaisuuden havainnointi, vaan rasistisuus. Siihen syyllistyy – onneksi – vain pieni osa väestöstä.  ”MYYTTI NUMERO 2: RASISTIT OVAT PIKKUPOIKIA, SYRJÄYTNEITÄ TAI IDIOOTTEJA.  Väärin. Ne, jotka tunnustautuvat rasisteiksi edustavat jotakuinkin läpileikkausta kansasta. Heitä on miehiä ja naisia, lääkäreitä, putkiasentajia, tohtoreita, autonkuljettajia, johtajia, leipureita, presidenttejä, taiteilijoita, hippejä, osastopäälliköitä... koska hyysärien äänekäs ja asiaton propaganda on niin laajalle levinnyttä, on rasisteilla joidenkin silmissä huono maine, joten erityisesti sosiaalisessa arvoasemassa korkealla olevat usein pidättäytyvät ilmaisemasta rasistisia kantojaan - joita heillä toki on.”  *Mover*: On totta, että rasisteja on monissa ihmisryhmissä. Mutta enimmäkseen he ovat korkeintaan vähäisen koulutuksen saaneita.  ”MYYTTI NUMERO 3: RASISMI JOHTAA VÄKIVALTAAN.  Väärin. Todellisuudessa rasismi ehkäisee väkivaltaa pyrkiessään pitämään toisiinsa sopeutumattomat kulttuurit erillään. Sitäpaitsi rasismi on vain neutraali kyky tehdä kulttuurillisia havaintoja ja tunnustaa ihmisryhmien erilaisuus.”  *Mover*: Rasismi on väkivaltaa – henkistä tai ruumiillista.  ”MYYTTI NUMERO 4: RASISTI PELKÄÄ ERILAISUUTTA.  Väärin. Rasisti päinvastoin kunnioittaa erilaisuutta ja toimii erilaisten kulttuurien säilyttämiseksi pitämällä kulttuurit erillään ja näin vaalimalla niiden omintakeisuutta ja oikeutta omiin tapoihinsa. Hyysäri taas pelkää kaikkea erilaista ja siksi haluaa tuhota kaikki maailman kulttuurit luodakseen yhden globaalin monokulttuurin, joka on kaikkialla maapallolla samanlainen.”  *Mover*: Kunnioitusta ei ole halu estää keinotekoisesti kanssakäyminen.  ”MYYTTI NUMERO 5: ROTUJA EI OLE.  Väärin. Rotu on ensinnäkin käsite. Kaikki käsitteet ovat ihmisen luomia ja niiden sisältö on näin ihmisen itsensä määriteltävissä. Luonnossa ei sinänsä ole mitään rajoja tai luokkia, koska luonnossa ei ole mitään tällaisia rajoja luovaa SUBJEKTIA. Eläinrotuja katsotaan olevan, vaikka usein kaksi eläintä muistuttaa toisiaan enemmän kuin vaikkapa valkoinen ja musta ihminen toisiaan. Rotujen olemassaolon kieltäminen on paitsi geneettistä harhaoppia ja arkipäivän kokemuksen vastainen, myös joutavaa poliittisesti korrektiutta tavoittelevaa liirumlaarumia, jolla vain yritetään olla sanomatta mitään, mikä voisi tuoda esille kiusallisia tosiasioita.”  *Mover*: Tässä nyt kirjoittaja väittää yhtä ja perustelee toista. Joka tapauksessa - rotujen olemassaololla ei ole mitään tekemistä rasistisuuden kanssa.  ”MYYTTI NUMERO 6: IHMISRYHMIEN ÄLYSSÄ EI OLE EROJA.  Väärin. Jo Jeesus sanoi, että "hedelmistään puu tunnetaan". Paitsi tutkimukset älykkyysosamääristä, myös vilkaisu esim. Afrikkaan osoittaa, että ihmisryhmien kollektiivisissa henkisissä kyvyissä on todellakin MERKITTÄVIÄ keskinäisiä eroja. Kuitenkin jokin musta yksilö saattaa olla älykkäämpi kuin jokin tietty valkoinen, mutta suurien joukkojen tasolla valkoinen on ylivertainen.”  *Mover*: Ihmisryhmien mahdollisella älykkyyserolla ei ole mitään tekemistä rasistisuuden kanssa.  ”MYYTTI NUMERO 7: MUSTAT SOPEUTUVAT KULTTUURIIMME.  Väärin. Kaikkialla lännessä mustat ovat yliedustettuina työttömien ja lusijoiden joukossa. Esim. Britanniassa valkoisia ja aasialaisia istuu vankiloissa vähemmän kuin heidän määränsä populaatiossa antaisi olettaa, ja mustia taas noin 7 kertaa enemmän. USA:ssa mustista äideistä 45% on yksinhuoltajia ja trendi on vain kasvussa.”  *Mover*:Kaikki sosiaaliset ilmiöt ovat suhteellisia – eivätkö mustavalkoisia.  "MYYTTI NUMERO 10: POLYKULTTUURISUUS ON PAREMPI KUIN MONOKULTTUURISUUS.  Väärin. Jos erilaisen kulttuurin omaavat ihmiset ovat suurin joukoin tekemisissä keskenään, syntyy väistämättä myös konflikteja. Monokulttuuri voi olla myös voimavara, eikä kritiikitön sekametelisoppakulttuuri ole automaattisesti paras - sen ovat uutiset maailmalta ja Suomesta meille osoittaneet."  *Mover*: Sen enempää poly- kuin monokulttuurisuuskaan ei ole itseisarvo – mutta kumpikin on toimiva ja mahdollinen.  ”MYYTTI NUMERO 12: VAIN VALKOISET OVAT RASISTEJA.  Väärin. Humanistinen perinne ja yleinen suvaitsevaisuus demokratian ohella pitävät huolen siitä, että länsimailla ei tuoda rasismia läheskään niin selkeästi esiin kuin esim. Afrikassa, jossa valkoisia maanviljelijöitä tapetaan ihonvärinsä vuoksi ja toiseen heimoon kuuluvia kiduttaa.”  *Mover*: Tämä – jos sitä joku nyt on yleensä esittänyt – on tietenkin myytti.  "MYYTTI NUMERO 14: AFRIKKAA VOIDAAN AUTTAA OTTAMALLA PAKOLAISIA.  Väärin. Se vain kurjistaa Afrikan tilannetta, sillä näin yleensä työikäiset miehet, jotka voisivat rakentaa maataan, lähtevät länteen ja jättävät naiset ja lapset kuolemaan sodan ja nälän jalkoihin. Lisäksi afrikkalaiset uskaltavat turvallisimmin mielin hyökätä naapuriheimon kimppuun, kun voivat alakynteen jäädessään lähteä esim. Suomeen sotapakolaisina. Afrikka tarvitsisi kipeästi niitä koulutettuja mustia, jotka ovat saaneet oppinsa länsimailla."  *Mover*: Yksittäisiä ihmisiä voidaan auttaa ottamalla pakolaisia. Hätä on ensisijainen kriteeri, sitten tulevat muut.  "MYYTTI NUMERO 15: MEILLÄ ON MORAALINEN VELVOLLISUUS MAKSAA KEHITYSAPUA.  Väärin. Suomi ei ole ollut Afrikassa siirtomaaherrana. Toisekseen Afrikka on luonnonvaroiltaan rikkauden ylitsevuotava suurvalta köyhän Suomen rinnalla - meillä on vain tukkipuuta ja talvisin lunta. Jos varallisuus olisi mittarina, Afrikka tukisi joka vuosi Suomea merkittävillä summilla."  *Mover*: Moraali ei vaadi vastiketta.	0

Olen ollut kauppiaana jo 30 vuotta paikkakunnilla Suomessa. Minulla käy tällähetkellä kaupassani asiakkaita non 1500 - 2000 henkilöä päivässä. Minulla ei ole ollut kymmeneen vuoteen yhtään oikeasti ostavaa romani asiakasta. Sensijaan kuukausittain käy iso mustalaislauma aiheuttamassa hirveän härdelin, kun he poistuvat liikkeestä huomataan taas ison määrän tavaroita kadonneeksi. Tätä tapahtuu minulle ja tuntemieni yrittäjien liikkeille kokoajan. Minulta on urani aikana varastettu mustalaisten toimesta hienon omakotitalon verran tavaraa. Tule sieltä sveitsistäsi vaikka kuukaudeksi töihin isoon kauppaan Suomessa ja näe tämä mustalaisten varastelu. Tule sitten kyselemään onko sulla joku ongelma!

6666	fin_test_666	israelilainen urheus  Aika naurettavaa tuo Israelin "urhojen" pelehtiminen. Pullapojat kituuttaa satoja viattomia palestiinalaisia siviilejä, naisia ja lapsia, kurjissa oloissa vankiloissa, samalla kun vaativat yhtä ainoaa sotavankia takaisin käyttäen kollektiivistä kiristystä viattomaan kansanosaan.  Paineet hallitusta kohtaan ovat Israelissa varmasti kovat, kun yksi sotilasrukka ei ole saapunut äidin hellan ääreen kosheria maistelemaan. Ei muuta kuin ampumaan USAn toimittamilla tykeillä naisia ja lapsia riekaleiksi paksun betonimuurin takaa. Samalla raukkamaiset lastenmurhaajat muistuttavat, että sotilaan vahingoittaminen tietäisi taivaan tippumista niskaan. Ilmeisesti tämäkin tapahtuisi israelilaisen "sankarillisesti" tuhoamalla "vihollinen" (siis naiset ja lapset) risteilyohjuksin, ilman, että sotilaalta katkeaisi kynttäkään.  On ihan oikein, että saavat maistaa sitä päivittäistä huolta ja tuskaa, jota ovat jo kymmenien vuosien ajan tuottaneet palestiinalaisille äideille. Valitettavasti tämä sotilasparasta koettu tuska on vain murto-osa siitä. Juutalainen "urheus" saa tässä kyllä antaisemansa leiman, jälleen.	0

6668	fin_test_668	Tampere on köyhien kaupunki  Tampereella asuu kaikki suomen köyhät, laittaa vain toriin ilmoituksen, että myyn 20-100e itselle tarpeetonta, niin kukaan ei soita. 90% ajaa osamaksu autolla, ruoka ostetaan kulutusluotolla kuukausi etukäteen, huonekalut, kodinkoneet,älykännykän saa 3,00e kk maksaa ja vuokra viedään tilistä, niin eihän kellään ole 20e taskussa, vain se muoviläpyskä, jolla ei saa seinästä rahaa, mutta kaupan kassa hyväksyy velaksi ostamisen. Miten pormestarit ajatteli myydä uudet asunnot ja kenelle? Liike ja toimistotilaa tehdään lisää, vaikka 100 000 neliötä on tyhjänä, mitä varten? Ei Tampere elä pelkällä ratikalla, pakolaisilla, pizzanmyynnillä ja niillä sadoilla kaljapaikoilla, urheilulla? Tänne täytyy saada vientiteollisuutta, mutta tehtaat on tuhottu ja työpaikat siirtynyt ympäristökuntiin. Ennen keskustassa oli 20 000 teollista työpaikkaa ja työmatkatkaliikenne toimi busseilla, ei ollut ruuhkia? Nyt on tunneleita, ohitusteitä, tulee ratikka, mitä varten, kun bussit joustaa, mutta ratikka ei. Ja, ketä varten, keskusta on kuollut lähiö, jossa ei ole enään tuottavaa työtä, mutta eläkeläisiä, narkkareita ja työttömiä 20 000? Hyvin hoidettu johtaminen , näin ne naiset hoitaa kaupungin velkaiseksi ja siitä joutuu kärsimään vanhukset, työttömät ja meidän lapsetkin vielä 30 vuotta. Hölmöläisten kaupunki, kun äänestetään porvareita, me työläisten lapset. Mitä voi kaupunkilaisilta vaatia, kun joka kylässä poljetaan pyörää sisähallissa ja vielä maksetaan siitä, hölmö joka maksaa.

Kyllä ovat. Suomenruotsalaisella logiikalla 5% vähemmistön ei tarvitse osata maan pääkieltä, mutta loppujen 95 prosentin pitää kyllä osata ruotsia.

6785	fin_test_785	Väität, että saat Yksityisten alojen työttömyyskassasta samat edut, kuin ammattiliitosta. Väitteesi ei pidä alkuunkaan paikkaansa. Ensinnäkään Yksityisten alojen työttömyyskassa ei ole mikään liitto, vaan pelkästään työttömyyskorvauksen maksaja minimipalvelulla. Edunvalvontaasi liittyviä palveluja sieltä et saa, koska sopimukset solmii ja työehtojen toteutumista valvoo alan ammattiliitto. Ammattiliitoilta saat myös asiamies- ja lakimiespalveluja. Todennäköisesti olet joku tietoisesti provosoija, mutta jos olet todella noin tyhmä, niin sinua ja sinunlaisiasi työnantajat kusettavat pahimmin. Sellaista on helppo kusettaa, joka luulee tietävänsä kaiken, mutta itseasiassa ei tiedä juuri mitään. Tyhmyyttäsi ja tietämättömyyttäsi osoittaa myös se, että kuvittelet asian olevan sillä selvä, että TES: si on luettavanasi. TES:sien tulkinta on aivan oma lajinsa ja yhdellä tulkinnalla saattaa tulla kerralla koko vuoden liiton jäsenmaksua vastaava rahamäärä työntekijälle. Mitä siihen sinun hulluuteesi tulee, niin se sinun täytyy selvittää jossakin yhteiskunnan ylläpitämässä laitoksessa. Siinä edes ammattiliitto ei sinua voi auttaa. Ammattiliitot tosin edistävät kyseisten laitosten toimintaa sillä, että ne ulosmittaavat ahneelta kansainväliseltä pääomalta verotuloja, joilla rahoitetaan mm. kyseisten laitosten toimintaa. En ota tässä kantaa sinun luettelemiisi genitaalitermeihin. Pyydä selvittämään siellä hoitolaitoksessa, miksi ne kuuluvat niin viljalti sinun sanavarastoosi.	0
